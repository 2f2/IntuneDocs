# Prepare Android apps for mobile application management with the Intune App Wrapping Tool

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](/intune-classic/includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Use the Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android to change the behavior of your in-house Android apps by restricting features of the app without changing the code of the app itself.

The tool is a Windows command-line application that runs in PowerShell and creates a wrapper around your Android app. After the app is wrapped, you can change the appâ€™s functionality by configuring [mobile application management policies](configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console.md) in Intune.


Before running the tool, review [Security considerations for running the App Wrapping Tool](#security-considerations-for-running-the-app-wrapping-tool). To download the tool, go to the [Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-android) on GitHub.



## Fulfill the prerequisites for using the App Wrapping Tool

-   You must run the App Wrapping Tool on a Windows computer running Windows 7 or later.

-   Your input app must be a valid Android application package with the file extension .apk and:

    -   It cannot be encrypted.
    -   It must not have previously been wrapped by the Intune App Wrapping Tool.
    -   It must be written for Android 4.0 or later.

-   The app must be developed by or for your company. You cannot use this tool on apps downloaded from the Google Play Store.

-   To run the App Wrapping Tool, you must install the latest version of the [Java Runtime Environment](http://java.com/download/) and then ensure that the Java path variable has been set to C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath in your Windows environment variables. For more help, see the [Java documentation](http://java.com/download/help/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > In some cases, the 32-bit version of Java may result in memory issues. It's a good idea to install the 64-bit version.

- Android requires all app packages (.apk) to be signed. Use Java keytool to generate credentials needed to sign the wrapped output app. For example, the following command uses the Java executable keytool.exe to generate keys that can be used by the App Wrapping Tool to sign the wrapped output app.

	```
	keytool.exe -genkeypair -v -keystore mykeystorefile -alias mykeyalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 50000
	```
	This example generates a key pair (a public key and associated private key of 2,048 bits) by using the RSA algorithm. It then wraps the public key into an X.509 v3 self-signed certificate, which is stored as a single-element certificate chain. This certificate chain and the private key are stored in a new keystore entry named "mykeystorefile" and identified by the alias "mykeyalias." The keystore entry is valid for 50,000 days.

	The command will prompt you to provide passwords for the keystore and key. Use passwords that are secure, but make a note of them because they're needed to run the App Wrapping Tool.

	For detailed documentation, read more about the Java [keytool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html) and Java [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.html) on the Oracle documentation website.

## Install the App Wrapping Tool

1.  From the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-android), download the installation file InstallAWT.exe for the Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android to a Windows computer. Open the installation file.

2.  Accept the license agreement, then finish the installation.

Note the folder to which you installed the tool. The default location is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management\Android\App Wrapping Tool.

## Run the App Wrapping Tool

1.  On the Windows computer where you installed the App Wrapping Tool, open a PowerShell window in administrator mode.

2.  From the folder where you installed the tool, import the App Wrapping Tool PowerShell module:

    ```
    Import-Module .\IntuneAppWrappingTool.psm1
    ```

3.  Run the tool by using the **invoke-AppWrappingTool** command, which has the following usage syntax:
	```
	Invoke-AppWrappingTool [-InputPath] <String> [-OutputPath] <String> -KeyStorePath <String> -KeyStorePassword <SecureString>
    -KeyAlias <String> -KeyPassword <SecureString> [-SigAlg <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
	```

 The following table details the properties of the **invoke-AppWrappingTool** command:

|Property|Information|Example|
|-------------|--------------------|---------|
|**-InputPath**&lt;String&gt;|Path of the source Android app (.apk).| |
|**-OutputPath**&lt;String&gt;|Path to the output Android app. If this is the same directory path as InputPath, the packaging will fail.| |
|**-KeyStorePath**&lt;String&gt;|Path to the keystore file that has the public/private key pair for signing.|By default, keystore files are stored in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jreX.X.X_XX\bin." |
|**-KeyStorePassword**&lt;SecureString&gt;|Password used to decrypt the keystore. Android requires all application packages (.apk) to be signed. Use Java keytool to generate the KeyStorePassword. Read more about Java [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.html) here.| |
|**-KeyAlias**&lt;String&gt;|Name of the key to be used for signing.| |
|**-KeyPassword**&lt;SecureString&gt;|Password used to decrypt the private key that will be used for signing.| |
|**-SigAlg**&lt;SecureString&gt;| (Optional) The name of the signature algorithm to be used for signing. The algorithm must be compatible with the private key.|Examples: SHA256withRSA, SHA1withRSA, MD5withRSA|
| **&lt;CommonParameters&gt;** | (Optional) The command supports common PowerShell parameters like verbose and debug. |


- For a list of common parameters, see the [Microsoft Script Center](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847884.aspx).

- To see detailed usage information for the tool, enter the command:

    ```
    Help Invoke-AppWrappingTool
    ```

**Example:**

Import the PowerShell module.
```
Import-Module "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management\Android\App Wrapping Tool\IntuneAppWrappingTool.psm1"
```
Run the App Wrapping Tool on the native app HelloWorld.apk.
```
invoke-AppWrappingTool -InputPath .\app\HelloWorld.apk -OutputPath .\app_wrapped\HelloWorld_wrapped.apk -KeyStorePath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_91\bin\mykeystorefile" -keyAlias mykeyalias -SigAlg SHA1withRSA -Verbose
```

You will then be prompted for **KeyStorePassword** and **KeyPassword**. Enter the credentials you used to create the key store file.

The wrapped app and a log file are generated and saved in the output path you specified.

## Security considerations for running the App Wrapping Tool
To prevent potential spoofing, information disclosure, and elevation of privilege attacks:

-   Ensure that the input line-of-business (LOB) application, output application, and Java KeyStore are on the same Windows computer where the App Wrapping Tool is running.

-   Import the output application to the Intune console on the same machine where the tool is running. See [keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html) for more about about Java keytool.

-   If the output application and the tool are on a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path and you are not running the tool and input files on the same computer, set up the environment to be secure by using [Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) or [Server Message Block (SMB) signing](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429).

-   Ensure that the application is coming from a trusted source.

-   Secure the output directory that has the wrapped app. Consider using a user-level directory for the output.
