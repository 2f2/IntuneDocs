## Skycure MTD toogle options in Intune

You can decide which Skycure MTD toggle options you need to enable according you organization's requirements. Here are more details:

- **Connect Android 4.1+ devices to Skycure for Work MTD**: When you enable this option, you can have Android 4.1+ devices reporting security risk back to Intune.
	- **Mark as non-compliant if no data is received**: If Intune doesn't receive data about a device on this platform from the MTD partner, consider the device non-compliant.
<br></br>
- **Connect iOS 8.0+ devices to Skycure for Work MTD**: When you enable this option, you can have Android 4.1+ devices reporting security risk back to Intune.
	- **Mark as non-compliant if no data is received**: If Intune doesn't receive data about a device on this platform from the MTD partner, consider the device non-compliant.
<br></br>
- **Block unsupported OS versions**: Block if the device is running an operating system less than the minimum supported version.

- **Number of days until partner is unresponsive**: Number of days of inactivity before Intune considers teh partner to be unresponsive because the connection is lost. Intune ignores compliance state for unresponsive MTD partners.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You must configure the Skycure apps before creating compliance policy rules and configuring conditional access. This ensures that the app is ready and available for end users to install before they can get access to email or other company resources.
