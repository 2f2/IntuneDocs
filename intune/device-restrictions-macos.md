# macOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article lists and describes the different settings you can control on macOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your macOS devices.

## Before you begin

[Create a device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md#create-the-profile).

## General

- **Block Definition Lookup**: **Block** prevents user from highlighting a word, and then looking up its definition on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows access to the definition lookup feature.
- **Block Dictation**: **Block** stops the user from using voice input to enter text. **Not configured** (default) allows the user to use dictation input.
- **Block content caching**: Choose **Not configured** (default) to enable content caching. Content caching stores app data, web browser data, downloads, and more locally on the device. Select **Block** to prevent this data from being stored in the cache.

  For more information on content caching on macOS, see [Manage content caching on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/manage-content-caching-on-mac-mchl3b6c3720/mac) (opens another website).

  This feature applies to:  
  - macOS 10.13 and later

- **Defer software updates**: When set to **Not configured** (default), software updates are shown on the device as Apple releases them. For example, if a macOS update gets released by Apple on a specific date, then that update naturally shows up on the device around the release date. Seed build updates are allowed without delay.

  **Enable** allows you to delay when software updates are shown on devices, from 0-90 days. This setting doesn't control when updates are or aren't installed. 

  - **Delay visibility of software updates**: Enter a value from 0-90 days. When the delay expires, users get a notification to update to the earliest version of the OS available when the delay was triggered.

    For example, if a macOS update is available on **January 1**, and **Delay visibility** is set to **5 days**, then the update isn't shown as an available update. On the **sixth day** following the release, that update is available, and end users can install it.

    This feature applies to:  
    - macOS 10.13.4 and later

- **Screenshots**: Device must be in Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP). When set to **Block**, users can't save a screenshot of the display. It also prevents the Classroom app from observing remote screens. **Not configured** (default) allows users to capture screenshots, and allows the Classroom app to view remote screens.
  - **Remote screen observation through Classroom app**: **Disable** prevents teachers from using the Classroom app to see their students' screens. **Not configured** (default) allows teachers to see their students' screens.

    This setting is available when the **Screenshots** setting is allowed.

  - **Unprompted screen observation by Classroom app**: **Allow** lets teachers see their students’ screens without requiring the student to agree. **Not configured** (default) requires the student to agree before the teacher can see the screens.

    This setting is available when the **Screenshots** setting is set to not configured and screenshots are allowed.

- **Students must request permission to leave Classroom class**: Device must be in Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP). **Require** forces students enrolled in an unmanaged Classroom course to get teacher approval to leave the course. **Not configured** (default) allows student to leave the course whenever.
- **Teachers can automatically lock devices or apps in the Classroom app**: Device must be in Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP). **Allow** lets teachers lock a student's device or app without the student's approval. **Not configured** (default) requires the student to agree before the teacher can lock the device or app.
- **Students can automatically join Classroom class**: Device must be in Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP). **Allow** lets students join a class without prompting the teacher. **Not configured** (default) requires teacher approval to join a class.

## Password

- **Password**: **Require** the end user to enter a password to access the device. **Not configured** (default) doesn't require a password. It also doesn't force any restrictions, such as blocking simple passwords or setting a minimum length.
  - **Required password type**: Specify whether the password can be Numeric only, or whether it must be Alphanumeric (contain letters and numbers). This setting is supported only on Mac OS X version 10.10.3 and later.
  - **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**: Specify the number of complex characters required in the password (**0** to **4**).<br>A complex character is a symbol, for example "**?**".
  - **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length of password a user must configure (between **4** and **16** characters).
  - **Simple passwords**: Allow the use of simple passwords such as **0000** or **1234**.
  - **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**: Specify how long the computer must be inactive before a password is required to unlock it.
  - **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**: Specify the length of time that the computer must be idle before the screen locks.
  - **Password expiration (days)**: Specify how many days elapse before the user must change the password (**1** to **255** days).
  - **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be reused, from **1** to **24**.

- **Block User from Modifying Passcode**: Choose **Block** to stop the passcode from being changed, added, or removed. **Not configured** (default) allows passcodes to be added, changed, or removed.
- **Block Fingerprint Unlock**: Choose **Block** to prevent using a fingerprint to unlock the device. **Not configured** (default) allows the user to unlock the device using a fingerprint.

- **Block password AutoFill**: Choose **Block** to prevent using the AutoFill Passwords feature on macOS. Choosing **Block** also has the following impact:

  - Users aren't prompted to use a saved password in Safari or in any apps.
  - Automatic Strong Passwords are disabled, and strong passwords aren't suggested to users.

  **Not configured** (default) allows these features.

- **Block password proximity requests**: Choose **Block** so a user’s device doesn't request passwords from nearby devices. **Not configured** (default) allows these password requests.

- **Block password sharing**: **Block** prevents sharing passwords between devices using AirDrop. **Not configured** (default) allows passwords to be shared.

## Built-in Apps

- **Block Safari AutoFill**: **Block** disables the autofill feature in Safari on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows users to change autocomplete settings in the web browser.
- **Block Camera**: Choose **Block** to prevent access to the camera on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows access to the device's camera.
- **Block Apple Music**: **Block** reverts the Music app to classic mode and disables the Music service. **Not configured** (default) allows using the Apple Music app.
- **Block Spotlight Internet Search Results**: **Block** stops Spotlight from returning any results from an Internet search. **Not configured** (default) allows Spotlight search connect to the Internet to provide search results.
- **Block File Transfer using iTunes**: **Block** disables application file sharing services. Available in macOS 10.13 and later. **Not configured** (default) allows application file sharing services.

## Restricted apps

In the restricted apps list, you can configure one of the following lists:

- A **Prohibited apps** list: List the apps not managed by Intune that users aren't allowed to install and run. Users aren't prevented from installing a prohibited app, but if they do, it's reported to the administrator.
- An **Approved apps** list: List the apps that users are allowed to install. Users must not install apps that aren't listed. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed. Users aren't prevented from installing an app that isn't on the approved list. But, if they do, it's reported to the administrator.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the bundle ID of the app (for example *com.apple.calculator*).

## Connected devices

- **Block AirDrop**: **Block** prevents using AirDrop on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows using the AirDrop feature to exchange content with nearby devices.
