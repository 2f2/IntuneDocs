# How to monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Intune provides a number of ways in which you can monitor the properties of apps you manage, as well as their assignment status.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **All services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** group.
3. Choose **Mobile Apps**, then choose **Apps** in the **Manage** group.
5. In the list of apps, choose an app you want to monitor. You'll then see the app blade with an overview of the device status and the user status.

## App overview blade

You can use the specific app blade to review details about the status of an app in your environment.

### Essentials
The **Essentials** section contains the following information about the app:

 | **App Details**            | **Description**                                                      |

| **Publisher**          | Publisher of the app.                                            |
