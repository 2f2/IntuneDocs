# Getting started with Intune in the Azure portal

The Azure portal is where you can find the Intune service. There's a lot of services in Azure, many of which you may not use on a regular basis. Customizing your dashboard and sidebar can help you find the right information quickly every time you log in to manage devices with Intune.

## Sidebar

The __sidebar__ on the left side of the Azure portal shows you a list of all the available Azure services. This comprehensive list can be modified from its default view so that you can keep a persistent view of the services that matter most to you. We'll use Intune as the example of a service to add to the top of the list.
