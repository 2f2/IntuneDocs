# Quickstart: Create and assign a custom role

In this quickstart, you'll create a custom role with specific permissions for a helpdesk operator dedicated to lost passwords and devices. Then you'll assign the roll to a group of such operators. By creating custom roles like this one, you can control access to all parts of your mobile device management system.

If you donâ€™t have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Sign in to Intune

Sign in to the [Intune](https://aka.ms/intuneportal) as a Global Administrator or an Intune Service Administrator.

## Create a custom role

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the
procedure.

1. In Intune, choose **Roles** > **All roles** > **Add**.

2. Under **Add custom role**, in the **Name** box, enter *Remote device helpdesk*.
3. In the **Description** box, enter *This role lets a helpdesk operator help locate lost devices and reset forgotten passcodes*.
4. Choose **Configure** > **Remote tasks**.
5. Set the following permissions to **Yes**:
    - **Disable lost mode**
    - **Enable lost mode**
    - **Locate device**
    - **Play lost mode sound**
    - **Remote lock**
    - **Reset passcode**
    - **Wipe**
6. Choose **OK** > **OK** > **Create**.

## Assign the custom role to a group

Before your helpdesk operator can enjoy the new permissions, you must assign the role to a group that contains the helpdesk user.

1. In Intune, choose **Roles** > **All roles** > **Remote device helpdesk**.
2. Under **Intune roles**, choose **Assignments** > **Assign**.
3. In the **Assignment name** box, enter *Helpdesk ops*.
4. Choose **Member (Groups)** > **Add**.
5. Choose a group that contains your helpdesk operators who will handle remote devices.
6. Choose **Select** > **OK**.
7. Choose **Scope (Groups)** > **Select groups to include** > choose the same group as before.
8. Choose **Select** > **OK** > **OK**.

## Clean up resources

To delete the custom role, choose **Roles** > **All roles** > choose the ellipses next to the role > **Delete**.

## Next steps

After you've created and assigned a custom role, helpdesk personnel can remotely help users such as by [resetting the device passcode](device-passcode-reset.md).
