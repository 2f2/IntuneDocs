# Quickstart: Create and assign a custom role

In this Intune quickstart, you'll create a custom role with specific permissions for a security operations department. Then you'll assign the role to a group of such operators. By creating custom roles like this one, you can control access to all parts of your mobile device management system.

If you donâ€™t have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Sign in to Intune

Sign in to [Intune](https://aka.ms/intuneportal) as a Global Administrator or an Intune Service Administrator.

## Create a custom role

When you create a custom role, you can set permissions for a wide range of actions. For the security operations role, we'll set a few Read permissions so that the operator can review a device's configurations and policies.

1. In Intune, choose **Roles** > **All roles** > **Add**.

2. Under **Add custom role**, in the **Name** box, enter *Security operations*.
3. In the **Description** box, enter *This role lets a security operator monitor device configuration and compliance information.*
4. Choose **Configure** > **Corporate device identifiers** > **Yes** next to **Read** > **OK**.
5. Choose **Device compliance policies** > **Yes** next to **Read** > **OK**.
6. Choose **Device configurations** > **Yes** next to **Read** > **OK**.
7. Choose **Organization** > **Yes** next to **Read** > **OK**.
8. Choose **OK** > **Create**.

## Assign the role to a group

Before your security operator can use the new permissions, you must assign the role to a group that contains the security user.

1. In Intune, choose **Roles** > **All roles** > **Remote device helpdesk**.
2. Under **Intune roles**, choose **Assignments** > **Assign**.
3. In the **Assignment name** box, enter *Sec ops*.
4. Choose **Member (Groups)** > **Add**.
5. Choose a group that contains your helpdesk operators who will handle remote devices.
6. Choose **Select** > **OK**.
7. Choose **Scope (Groups)** > **Select groups to include** > choose the same group as before.
8. Choose **Select** > **OK** > **OK**.

## Clean up resources

If you don't want to use the new custom role any more, you can delete it. Choose **Roles** > **All roles** > choose the ellipses next to the role > **Delete**.
