# Special migration considerations

[!INCLUDE[note for both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

There are special migration considerations which may be applicable depending on your existing MDM provider environment.

## Factory reset for Appleâ€™s Device Enrollment Program (DEP)

The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) sets device configurations that cannot be removed by the end user. To retain the advanced management features of DEP, the device must be returned to the out-of-box (new) state via factory reset to enroll to Intune.

To continue using DEP to manage the devices in Intune, [set up iOS device enrollment with Device Enrollment Program](/intune/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios).
