# How to get support for Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Intune. Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages.

Support for Intune, and for Intune when used with Configuration Manager, is free of charge. Premier Support customers incur charges for procedure questions (for example, how to go about configuring an Intune feature).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For technical support with products that work with Intune but not made by Microsoft, for example SaaSwedo, Cisco, or Lookout, contact the supplier of that product first. Before you open a request with Intune support, ensure you configured the other product correctly.

## Create an online support ticket

If you are unable to find answers by using the self-help resources, you can create an online support ticket.

**Limit each support ticket to a single issue**. This helps us serve you better. Here's why:

- Support engineers are likely to specialize in specific areas, and it's easier to identify the right subject matter experts to help with your issue.
- Engineering teams can prioritize their work in product areas where the most incidents are being generated.
- It's easier to escalate challenging issues to the correct resource.

### File a new support request
As an IT admin, you can file a support ticket from the Azure portal by using the following steps:

1. Log on to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) with your Intune admin credentials, choose the **?** icon in the upper-right corner of the portal, and then select **Help + support** to go to the [Azure Help + support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview target=_blank) page.

3. On the **Basics** blade, for most Intune 	technical support issues, choose the following:
	- **Issue type**: **Technical**
	- **Service**: **Microsoft Intune**
	- **Support plan**: **Technical support - included**  (For Intune technical issues, support is complimentary.)

	Choose **Next** to continue.
4. On the **Problem** blade, select **Severity**, **Problem type**, and **Category** to help us ensure your request is addressed by the right subject matter expert for your problem. This also lets us provide **Related help** that might solve your problem without filing a ticket.
