# Intune quick start guide

[!INCLUDE[both-portals](./includes/not-for-both-portals.md)]

This guide gets you started with your paid subscription to Microsoft Intune. Follow these steps to manage the mobile devices and Windows PCs, as well as apps in your organization. You can follow each step in order, or skip ahead if a step is not applicable to your environment or business needs. If you want to try out Intune, see the [Intune evaluation guide](/intune-classic/understand-explore/mobile-device-management-trial-guide-microsoft-intune).  

If you're currently using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager to manage computers and servers, you can [extend Configuration Manager to manage mobile devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/mdm/understand/choose-between-standalone-intune-and-hybrid-mobile-device-management).

>[!TIP]
>If you purchase at least 150 licenses for Intune in an eligible plan, you can use the *FastTrack Center Benefit*, which is a service where Microsoft specialists work with you to get your environment ready for Intune. See [FastTrack Center Benefit for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/enterprise-mobility-security/Solutions/enterprise-mobility-fasttrack-program).
