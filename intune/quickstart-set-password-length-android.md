# Quickstart: Create a password compliance policy for Android devices

In this quickstart, you will use Microsoft Intune to require your workforce's Android users to enter a password of a specific length before access is granted to information on their Android devices. 

An Intune device compliance policy specifies the rules and settings that devices must meet to be considered compliant. You can use compliance policies with conditional access to allow or block access to company resources. You can also get device reports and take actions for non-compliance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to password settings, you should also consider other system security settings to protect your workforce. For more information, see [System security settings](compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#system-security-settings).

If you donâ€™t have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Sign in to Intune

Sign in to the [Intune](https://aka.ms/intuneportal) as a Global Administrator or an Intune Service Administrator. 

## Create a device compliance policy

For this quickstart, you'll use Intune to require your workforce's Android users to enter a password of a specific length before access is granted to information on their Android devices.

1. In Intune, select **Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create Policy**.
2. Add **Android compliance** as the  **Name**. Also, add a **Description**.
3. For **Platform**, select **Android**. 
4. Select **Settings** > **System Security** to display the Android **System Security** blade.
5. Click **Require** next to **Require a password to unlock mobile devices**.
6. Enter **6** next to **Minimum password length**.

7. When done, click **OK** > **OK** > **Create** to create the policy.

When you've successfully created the policy, it will appear in your list of device complice policies. 

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the policy. To do so, select the compliance policy and click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used Intune to create a compliance policy for your workforce's Android devices to require a password of at least six characters in length.
