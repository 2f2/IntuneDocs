In this topic, you'll learn the following: 

- What you need before you can start creating a device compliance policy.
- A quick glance on what you can see and do in the Intune Azure preview portal.

##  Pre-requisites

-   A subscription to Intune

-   A subscription to Azure Active Directory

##  Supported Platforms:

-   Android

##  Azure portal workflow

Here is an overview of how you can create and manage device compliance in the Intune Azure preview portal.

<!---### Overview

When you choose the **Set device compliance** workload, the blade opens with an  **Overview** section that displays a summary view of your compliance policies that you have created and the status of the devices they have been applied to. If you
donâ€™t have any policies configured yet, the overview will just include the various reports but with no data.--->

### Manage

You can create, edit and delete compliance policies. You will also be able to assign policies to users from here.

<!---### Monitor

This section is a detailed view of what you see in the **Overview**. A list of all the reports are displayed in this section and you can interactively drill down through each of these reports.--->
