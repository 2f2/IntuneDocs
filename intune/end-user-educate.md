# How to educate your end users about Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Microsoft Intune helps you enable your workforce with mobile devices while keeping your corporate data protected. There are many steps to ensuring a successful deployment, including evaluating Intune through a [free trial](app-sdk.md).

None of these technologies will ensure that your users understand the importance of why you're managing their devices. In fact, many of users may feel as though you are infringing on their privacy - especially if you are deploying Intune as a [BYOD solution](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/byod-design-considerations-guide).

> [!Important]
> Understanding and proactively addressing user concerns about why your company needs to manage devices is critical to a successful rollout.

Adoption is not just about distributing working technology throughout your workforce. It's also about getting users to understand and embrace the secured access that Intune provides. To prevent users from being intimidated by enterprise mobility, explain what enterprise mobility is for, what it can do, and what it can't do. 

## Things to consider about your users

__What level of technology experience do users have?__ Your users' knowledge and experiences with technology may range. These experiences could be positive or negative, from photographing family on vacation, to dropping a device in the sink and losing valauble data. These experiences influence how users approach technology, and how they use devices for personal and business purposes.

__What does mobility management mean to users?__ Users may not fully understand the access you have, and do not have, to their devices and information. Lack of understanding may cause concern that IT and leadership could track user actions. Less experienced device owners may believe that all activity on their devices is kept private; other users may fear that a "big brother" is spying on their devices.

__How could Intune inconvenience users?__  The top priority of all Intune deployments is to secure corporate data. However, if you do things like require unreasonable passcodes on personal devices, or send required app updates in the middle of criticial business calls, you may negatively affect your user's attitude toward device management. Additionally, you could negatively affect their productivity at work. Recognize that it takes time out of a user's day to install apps, enroll devices, and maintain compliance.

## Things you should do

Read the following list of tips to make your organization's Intune deployment easier on device users.

* __Be resourceful.__ The Intune documentation has a variety of content to help users complete Intune-specific tasks, such as enrolling and troubleshooting devices. Users may click and access some articles directly from the Company Portal. These particular articles help explain the Company Portal app installation, Intune enrollment, general tasks that users can do on their devices, and troubleshooting. Documentation is found in the article how to [use managed devices to get work done](/intune-user-help/use-managed-devices-to-get-work-done).

* __Be accessible.__ Tell users where they can seek help for device problems. When you [customize the Company Portal](company-portal-customize.md), be sure to include your IT administrator's contact information.

* __Be personal.__ Providing instructions that aren't specific to your deployment can make end users feel like you haven't given any thought to their experience. Use this [customizable, Intune user enrollment template for IT administrators](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Intune-End-User-Enrollment-3a0c9b0c) to create your own enrollment instructions for your users.

* __Find different ways to communicate.__ As with [different learning styles](https://www.umassd.edu/dss/resources/facultystaff/howtoteachandaccommodate/howtoaccommodatedifferentlearningstyles/), users have preferred ways to consume information. For users that prefer video to documentation, we offer [video versions of how to enroll various device types](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/IntuneEnrollment) and more on Channel 9. These videos are available to embed directly into your own [SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-a-video-from-Office-365-Video-59e19984-c34e-4be8-889b-f6fa93910581) or for download of local copies - either of the video or just of the audio track.

* __Be aware.__ The Intune user experience impacts your productivity, and understanding the users experience makes it easier for you to troubleshoot device and user problems. For example, learn and understand how your users acquire their apps. Knowing this information will make it easier and faster to diagnose and fix problems.

* __Be forthcoming.__ Be clear about what you're going to manage on user devices. Tell users what kind of data you're collecting and why you're collecting it. Inform them of how you're planning to use all data. [Microsoft believes that you have a right to as much information as possible about how we handle your customer data in the cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/about/transparency), and we believe that this philosophy can greatly increase your end users' satisfaction with Intune.

>[!Note]
> Transparency, wherever possible, is fundamental to the success of your deployment.

You're trying to combine trust with well-crafted compliance policies to make sure that end users know that even if you *could* look at certain types of personal data, that you don't *want* to, and the liability that you could incur for invading their privacy. Crafting a statement with your legal and HR departments can help with particularly difficult employees.
