# How to educate your end users about Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Microsoft Intune helps you enable your workforce with mobile devices while protecting your corporate data. To test out the Intune deployment in your organization, you can try a [free trial](app-sdk.md).

As you implement Microsoft Intune, it's important to help your employees understand your reasons for device management. Without an explanation from you, some users might feel that you're infringing on their privacy. User concern for this increases when you deploy Intune as a [BYOD solution](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/byod-design-considerations-guide).

> [!Important]
> Understanding and proactively addressing user concerns about why your company needs to manage devices is critical to a successful rollout.

Successful adoption isn't just about distributing new, functional technology throughout your workforce. It's also about getting users to understand and embrace the new technology. In the case of Intune, its important for users to understand and embrace the data security that Intune provides. 

To prevent users from being intimidated by enterprise mobility, explain what enterprise mobility is for and how it is used in your organization.

## Things to consider about your users

__What level of technology experience do users have?__ Your users' knowledge and experiences with technology may range. These experiences could be positive, such as photographing family vacations; or they could be negative, such as unexpectedly dropping a device in the kitchen sink. Experiences influence how users approach technology for personal business use.

__What does mobility management mean to users?__ Users may not fully understand the access you have--or don't have--to their devices and information. Users likely have concern that IT and leadership could track their actions. Less experienced users may believe all activity on their devices is private. Other users may fear that a "big brother" is spying on their devices.

__How could Intune inconvenience users?__  The top priority of all Intune deployments is to secure corporate data. However, if you do things like require unreasonable passcodes on personal devices, or send required app updates in the middle of criticial business calls, you may negatively affect your user's attitude toward device management. Additionally, you could negatively affect their productivity at work. Recognize that it requires time to to install apps, enroll devices, and maintain compliance.

## Things you should do

Read the following list of tips to make your organization's Intune deployment easier on device users.

* __Be resourceful.__ The Intune documentation helps users complete Intune-specific tasks, such as enrolling and troubleshooting devices. Users may click and access some articles directly from the Company Portal. These particular articles help explain the Company Portal app installation, Intune enrollment, general tasks that users can do on their devices, and troubleshooting. Documentation is found in the article how to [use managed devices to get work done](/intune-user-help/use-managed-devices-to-get-work-done).

* __Be accessible.__ Tell users where they can seek help for device problems. When you [customize the Company Portal](company-portal-customize.md), be sure to include your IT administrator's contact information.

* __Be personal.__ Provide instructions that are specific to your deployment. This demonstrates to users that you care about their experience. Use this [customizable, Intune user enrollment template for IT administrators](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Intune-End-User-Enrollment-3a0c9b0c) to create your own enrollment instructions for your users.

* __Find different ways to communicate.__ Users have [different learning styles](https://www.umassd.edu/dss/resources/facultystaff/howtoteachandaccommodate/howtoaccommodatedifferentlearningstyles/) and preferred ways to consume information. For more visual learners, there are [video versions of how to enroll various device types](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/IntuneEnrollment) on Channel 9. Videos can be embedded directly into your own [SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-a-video-from-Office-365-Video-59e19984-c34e-4be8-889b-f6fa93910581). You can also download local copies of the video or audio track.

* __Be aware.__ The Intune user experience impacts your productivity, and understanding the users experience makes it easier for you to troubleshoot device and user problems. For example, learn and understand how your users acquire their apps. Knowing this information will make it easier and faster to diagnose and fix problems.

* __Be forthcoming.__ Be clear about what you're going to manage on user devices. Tell users what kind of data you're collecting and why you're collecting it. Inform them of how you're planning to use all data. [Microsoft believes that you have a right to as much information as possible about how we handle your customer data in the cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/about/transparency), and believes that this philosophy can greatly increase your end users' satisfaction with Intune.

>[!Note]
> Transparency, wherever possible, is fundamental to the success of your deployment.

It's important to combine trust with well-crafted compliance policies. Users should know that even if you *could* look at certain types of personal data, that you don't *want* to; and that there is liability that you could incur for invading their privacy. Creating a statement with your legal and HR departments may also help alleviate employee concerns.
