# Manage devices running Windows Holographic with Microsoft Intune


Microsoft Intune supports devices running Windows Holographic for Business, such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/).

To manage devices that run Windows Holographic with Microsoft Intune, you must create an Edition Upgrade profile to upgrade the devices from Windows Holographic to Windows Holographic for Business. For the Microsoft HoloLens, you can purchase the Commercial Suite to obtain the required license for the upgrade.
