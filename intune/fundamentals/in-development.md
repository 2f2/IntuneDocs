# In development for Microsoft Intune - November 2019

To help in your readiness and planning, this page lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information on this page:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's a preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Check back for additional updates.
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

## App management

### S/MIME support for Microsoft Outlook Mobile <!-- 2669398  -->
Intune will support delivering S/MIME signing and encryption certificates that can be used with Outlook Mobile on iOS and Android. For related information, see [email settings for iOS devices](~/configuration/email-settings-ios.md) and [e-mail settings for Android devices](~/configuration/email-settings-android.md).

### Custom settings support for macOS applications <!-- 4736278  -->
Intune will support custom settings, allowing you to add specific keys and values to an existing preferences property list (.plist) file to configure macOS apps and the device. Not all apps support managed preferences, and in some cases only specific settings can be managed. The settings are deployed via the device channel only. You should only upload property list files or .xml files that target device channel settings.

### Assignment type value in Windows Company Portal <!-- 5459950  -->
The **Installed Apps** page of the Windows Company Portal app will be updated. The **Assignment type** column of the **Installed Apps** page has been updated to be called "Required by your organization". Possible values are **Yes** or **No** to designate required vs. available apps. This change is being made in response to some end user confusion. For more information about the Windows Company portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](~/apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Apply dark mode in iOS Company Portal <!-- 4911422  -->
Dark mode is planned for iOS Company Portal. You'll be able to download company apps, manage your devices, and get IT support in the color scheme of your choice. For more information about iOS Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Run Win32 apps on Windows 10 S-mode devices <!-- 3747604  --> 
You'll be able to install and run Win32 apps on devices that are managed in Windows 10 S mode. Create one or more supplemental policies for S mode by using the Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) PowerShell tools. Use the Device Guard signing portal to sign the supplemental policies. Then upload and distribute the policies through Intune. 

In Intune, you'll find this capability by selecting **Client apps** > **Windows 10 S supplemental policies**. 

### Set app availability based on a date and time <!-- 3510685  -->
As an admin, you'll be able to configure the start time and deadline for a required app. At the start time, the Intune management extension will download the app content and cache it. The app will be installed at the deadline time. For available apps, the start time will dictate when the app is visible in Company Portal. 

To set app availability based on date and time:

1. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps**. 
1. Select an app from the list or add a new one by selecting **Add**. 
1. From the app blade, select **Assignments** > **Add group**. 
1. Set the **Assignment type** to **Required** and then select **Included Groups**. 
1. Set **Make this app required for all users** to **Yes**. 
1. Select **Edit** to modify the **End user experience** options. 
1. On the **End user experience** blade, set the **Software available time** as needed. 

For more information, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add.md).

### Require Win32 apps to restart <!-- 3136567  -->
You'll be able to require a Win32 app to restart after a successful installation. You can choose the amount of time (the grace period) before the restart.

### Display notifications for the Company Portal app on Windows <!-- 1808082  -->
We'll update the Company Portal app on Windows devices to display toast notifications to users, even when the application is closed. The update will show notifications for available apps only when the installation status is completed or failed. The Company Portal app won't show notifications for required applications.

### Display installation status messages for the Company Portal app <!-- 2514416  -->
The Company Portal app will show additional app installation status messages to end users. The following conditions will apply to new Win32 dependency features:
- App failed to install. Dependencies defined by the admin were not met.
- App installed successfully but requires a restart.
- App is in the process of installing but requires a restart to continue.

### Configure app notification content for organization accounts <!-- 2576686 -->
Intune APP on Android and iOS devices will allow you to control app notification content for organization accounts. This feature will require support from applications and might not be available for all APP-enabled applications. For more information about APP, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md)

The **Server-side logging for Siri commands** setting will be removed.

This setting will be removed from the Intune admin console. This setting has no effect on the device even though existing policies that have this setting configured will continue to show the setting. If you want to remove the setting from existing policies, go to the policy, make a minor edit, save it, and the policy will be updated.

To see the settings you can configure, see [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).
