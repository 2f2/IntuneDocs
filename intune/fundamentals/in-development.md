## App management

### Include another app configuration variable <!-- 4969237  -->
When creating an app configuration policy, you'll be able to include the `AAD Device ID` configuration variable as part of your configuration settings. 

To add the `AAD Device ID` configuration variable:
1. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add**. 
1. Enter your configuration policy details.
1. To view the **Configuration settings** blade, select **Configuration settings**.

### Apply dark mode in iOS Company Portal <!-- 4911422  -->
Dark mode is planned for iOS Company Portal. You'll be able to download company apps, manage your devices, and get IT support in the color scheme of your choice. For more information about iOS Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Prevent installation of apps from unknown sources on Android Enterprise devices <!-- 4760025  -->
On Android Enterprise work profile devices, end users can never install apps from unknown sources on the work profile. You'll be able to choose to extend this restriction to the personal profile as well. If you enable this restriction, end users on Android Enterprise work profile devices will also be prevented from side-loading apps from unknown sources onto the personal side of their device. 

### Use an updated app protection UI and iOS app provisioning UI <!-- 4102027, 4102029  -->
The UI to create and edit app protection policies (APP) and iOS app provisioning profiles in Intune will be updated. The UI changes include:
- A simplified experience that uses a wizard-style format on one blade. 
- An update to the create flow to include assignments.
- A summary. When you view properties before you create a new policy or when you edit a property, you'll see a summary page of all settings. Also, when you edit properties, the summary will list only items from the category of properties you're editing.

### Create groups of management objects called policy sets <!-- 3762880  -->
You'll be able to use policy sets to create a bundle of references to existing management entities that need to be identified, targeted, and monitored as a single conceptual unit. Policy sets don't replace existing concepts or objects. Admins can continue to assign individual objects as they do today. Policy sets reference individual objects. Therefore, any changes to those individual objects will be reflected in the policy set. 

To create a policy set in Intune, you'll select **Policy sets** > **Create**. 

### Run Win32 apps on Windows 10 S-mode devices <!-- 3747604  --> 
You'll be able to install and run Win32 apps on devices that are managed in Windows 10 S mode. Create one or more supplemental policies for S mode by using the Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) PowerShell tools. Use the Device Guard signing portal to sign the supplemental policies. Then upload and distribute the policies through Intune. 

In Intune, you'll find this capability by selecting **Client apps** > **Windows 10 S supplemental policies**. 

### Set app availability based on a date and time <!-- 3510685  -->
As an admin, you'll be able to configure the start time and deadline for a required app. At the start time, the Intune management extension will download the app content and cache it. The app will be installed at the deadline time. For available apps, the start time will dictate when the app is visible in Company Portal. 

To set app availability based on date and time:

1. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps**. 
1. Select an app from the list or add a new one by selecting **Add**. 
1. From the app blade, select **Assignments** > **Add group**. 
1. Set the **Assignment type** to **Required** and then select **Included Groups**. 
1. Set **Make this app required for all users** to **Yes**. 
1. Select **Edit** to modify the **End user experience** options. 
1. On the **End user experience** blade, set the **Software available time** as needed. 

For more information about adding apps, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add.md).

### Require Win32 apps to restart <!-- 3136567  -->
You'll be able to require a Win32 app to restart after a successful installation. You'll also be able to choose the amount of time (the grace period) before the restart.

### Display notifications for the Company Portal app on Windows <!-- 1808082  -->
The Company Portal app on Windows devices will be updated to display toast notifications to users, even when the application is closed. The update will show notifications for available apps only when the installation status is completed or failed. The Company Portal app won't show notifications for required applications.

### Display installation status messages for the Company Portal app <!-- 2514416  -->
The Company Portal app will show additional app installation status messages to end users. The following conditions will apply to new Win32 dependency features:
- App failed to install. Dependencies defined by the admin were not met.
- App installed successfully but requires a restart.
- App is in the process of installing but requires a restart to continue.

#### Assign the Microsoft Edge beta for macOS <!-- 4678761  -->
You'll be able to add and assign the latest version of the Microsoft Edge beta to Intune for macOS devices. 

To assign the Microsoft Edge beta for macOS devices:
1. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add app** > **Microsoft Edge - macOS**. 
1. Assign the Microsoft Edge beta to the intended groups. Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) keeps Microsoft Edge up to date. 
 
For more information about Microsoft Edge, see [Manage web access by using Microsoft Edge with Microsoft Intune](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md).

### Configure app notification content for organization accounts <!-- 2576686 -->
Intune APP on Android and iOS devices will allow you to control app notification content for organization accounts. This feature will require support from applications and might not be available for all APP-enabled applications. For more about APP, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md).

### Available Google Play app reporting for Android work profiles <!-- 3041956  -->
For available app installations on Android work profile devices, you can view the app installation status and the installed version of managed Google Play apps. For more information, see [How to monitor app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policies-monitor.md), [Manage Android work profile devices with Intune](../enrollment/android-enterprise-overview.md), and [Managed Google Play app types](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#managed-google-play-app-types).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration


### New device configuration settings for supervised iOS and iPadOS devices <!-- 5199328  -->
On iOS and iPadOS devices, you can create a profile to restrict features and settings on devices:

1. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
1. For the platform, select **iOS/iPadOS**.
1. For the profile type, select **Device restrictions**.

You'll be able to control new settings: 
- Access the network drive in the Files app  
- Access the USB drive in the Files app 
- Keep Wi-Fi on 

For information about the current settings, see [iOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

The new settings apply to:
- iOS 13.0 and newer.
- iPadOS 13.0 and newer.

### Removal of automatic connection in Wi-Fi profiles on Android and Android Enterprise <!-- 5021055  -->
On Android and Android Enterprise devices, you can create a Wi-Fi profile to configure different settings: 

1. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
1. For the platform, select **Android** or **Android Enterprise**.
1. For the profile type, select **Wi-Fi**. 

The **Connect automatically** setting will be removed because it's [not supported by Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.html#enableNetwork%28int%2c%20boolean%29).

If you use this setting in a Wi-Fi profile, you might notice that **Connect automatically** doesn't work. You don't need to take any action, but be aware that this setting will be removed from the Intune user interface.

For information about the current settings, go to [Android Wi-Fi settings](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android.md) or [Android Enterprise Wi-Fi settings](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

The removal of this setting applies to:
- Android.
- Android Enterprise.

### Global HTTP proxy on Android Enterprise devices <!-- 4816339  -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you will be able to configure a global HTTP proxy to meet your organization's web browsing standards:

1. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
1. For the platform, select **Android Enterprise**.
1. Select **Device owner**.
1. For the profile type, select **Device restrictions** for the profile type > 
1. Select **Connectivity**. 
 
After you configure the proxy, all HTTP traffic will use it. This feature applies to Android Enterprise devices that are in device-owner mode.

### New device firmware configuration interface profile for devices that run Windows 10 and later <!-- 2266073  -->
On Windows 10 and later, you can create a device configuration profile to control settings and features: 

1. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
1. For the platform, select **Windows 10 and later**. 
 
A new device firmware configuration interface profile type will allow Intune to manage UEFI (BIOS) settings.

For information about the current settings you can configure, see [Apply features and settings on your devices by using device profiles in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-profiles.md).

This feature applies to Windows 10 RS5 (1809) and later, on select devices.

### PKCS certificates for macOS  <!-- 1333650                -->
We'll add full support for Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) certificates on devices that run macOS. Users will be able to deploy user and device certificates with fields for customization subject and subject alternative name. 

We'll also have a new setting called Allow All Apps Access. Enable this setting to give all associated apps access to the private key. For more information about this setting, see [Configuration profile reference](https://developer.apple.com/business/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf) on Developer.Apple.com.

### Derived credentials to provision mobile devices with certificates      <!--  1736036, 1736037, 1772050      --> 
We'll add support for derived credentials, which support the *National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-157* standard for deploying certificates to devices.  Derived credentials rely on the use of a personal identity verification (PIV) or common access card (CAC) card, like a smart card. Users authenticate by using their smart card on a computer. They then request a certificate for their managed device by following the process required by the derived credential provider.   

The process to use derived credentials to get a certificate is different from processes that use SCEP or PKCS certificate profiles. But the result is the same: mobile devices that have authentication certificates that can be used for app authentication, VPN, Wi-Fi, or email profiles.   

For more information, see [Derived PIV credentials](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials) on NCCOE.NIST.gov.

The initial release of derived credentials will support Entrust Datacard, Intercede, and DISA Purebred on iOS. Additional platforms and derived credential providers will be supported in later releases.   

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device enrollment

### Specify which Android device OS versions enroll through the work profile and which enroll through the device administrator <!-- 4350697 -->

The summary will include all settings when you're viewing properties, when you're preparing to creating a new policy, and when you're editing a property. When you're editing, the summary will list only the items within the category of properties you're editing.

### Target macOS user groups to require Jamf management <!-- 4061739 -->
You'll be able to target specific groups of users to require their macOS devices to be managed by Jamf. This targeting will enable you to apply the Jamf compliance integration to a subset of macOS devices while other devices continue to be managed by Intune. Targeting will also let you gradually migrate users' devices from one mobile device management (MDM) system to the other.

### New restrictions for renaming Windows devices <!-- 3478938 -->
Device names will have to follow these rules:
- 15 characters or fewer (fewer than or equal to 63 bytes, not including a trailing NULL)
- No null or empty strings
- Allowed ASCII: letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens
- Allowed Unicode: characters >= 0x80, valid UTF8, mappable by IDN (RtlIdnToNameprepUnicode succeeds; see RFC 3492)
- Names must not contain only numbers or start with a number
- No spaces in the name
- Disallowed characters: { | } ~ [ \ ] ^ ' : ; < = > ? & @ ! " # $ % ` ( ) + / , . _ *

### Deploy software updates to macOS devices <!-- 3194876 -->
You'll be able to deploy software updates to groups of macOS devices. This feature includes critical, firmware, configuration file, and other updates. You'll be able to send updates on the next device check-in. Or you can select a weekly schedule to deploy updates in or out of time windows that you set. 

This feature helps when you want to update devices outside standard work hours or outside hours when your help desk is fully staffed. You'll also get a detailed report of all macOS devices that have updates deployed. You can drill into the report by device to see the status of a particular update.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Monitoring and troubleshooting

### Android report on the Devices overview page <!-- 2984353  -->
