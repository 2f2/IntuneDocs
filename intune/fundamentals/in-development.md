# In development for Microsoft Intune - December 2019

To help in your readiness and planning, this page lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information on this page:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's a preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Check back for additional updates.
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

> [!NOTE]
> This page reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in a future release. Dates and individual features might change. This page doesn't describe all features in development.

## App management

### User-licensed VPP apps for User Enrollment iOS devices<!-- 5619268 -->
For User Enrollment iOS devices, end-users will no longer be presented with device-licensed VPP applications deployed as available. However, end-users will continue to see all user-licensed VPP apps within the Company Portal. For more information about VPP apps, see [How to manage iOS and macOS apps purchased through Apple Volume Purchase Program with Microsoft Intune](~/apps/vpp-apps-ios.md).

### Retrieve personal recovery key from MEM encrypted macOS devices<!-- 4851745 -->
End-users will be able to retrieve their personal recovery key (FileVault key) using the iOS Company Portal app. The device that has the personal recovery key must be enrolled with Intune and encrypted with FileVault through Intune. Using the iOS Company Portal app, an end-user can open the Safari web view and retrieve their personal recovery key. In Intune, select **Devices** > *the encrypted and enrolled macOS device* > **Get recovery key**. For more information about FileVault, see [FileVault encryption for macOS](~/protect/encrypt-devices.md#filevault-encryption-for-macos).

### Display notifications for the Company Portal app on Windows<!-- 1808082  -->
We'll update the Company Portal app on Windows devices to display toast notifications to users, even when the application is closed. The update will show notifications for available apps only when the installation status is completed or failed. The Company Portal app won't show notifications for required applications.

### Display installation status messages for the Company Portal app<!-- 2514416  -->
The Company Portal app will show additional app installation status messages to end users. The following conditions will apply to new Win32 dependency features:
- App failed to install. Dependencies defined by the admin were not met.

## Device configuration

### Add automatic proxy settings to Wi-Fi profiles for Android Enterprise work profiles<!-- 4490822 idready -->
On Android Enterprise Work Profile devices, you can create Wi-Fi profiles. When you choose the Wi-Fi Enterprise type, you can also enter the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type used on your Wi-Fi network.

In a future update, when you choose the Enterprise type, you'll be able to enter automatic proxy settings, including a proxy server URL, such as `proxy.contoso.com`.

To see the current Wi-Fi settings you can configure, go to [Add Wi-Fi settings for devices running Android Enterprise and Android kiosk in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise work profile

### Enable network access control (NAC) with Cisco AnyConnect VPN on iOS devices<!-- 4860111 idready -->
On iOS devices, you can create a VPN profile, and use different connection types, including Cisco AnyConnect (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile type > **Cisco AnyConnect** for connection type). 

In a future update, you'll be able to enable network access control (NAC) with Cisco AnyConnect. To use this feature:

1. At [Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_guide_21/b_ise_admin_guide_20_chapter_01000.html), use the steps in **Configuring Microsoft Intune as an MDM Server** to configure the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) in Azure.
2. In the Intune device configuration profile, select the **Enable Network Access Control (NAC)** setting.

To see all the available VPN settings, go to [Configure VPN settings on iOS devices](../configuration/vpn-settings-ios.md).

Applies to:
- iOS

#### Wired network device configuration profiles for macOS devices<!-- 3508686  -->
A new macOS device configuration profile will be available that configures wired networks (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Wired Network** for profile type). Use this feature to create 802.1x profiles to manage wired networks, and deploy these wired networks to your macOS devices.

Applies to:
- macOS
