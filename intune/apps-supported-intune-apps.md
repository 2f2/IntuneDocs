# Microsoft Intune protected apps  

Intune managed apps are enabled with a rich set of mobile application protection policies. Managed apps allow you to:
- Restrict copy-and-paste and save-as functions
- Configure web links to open inside the secure Microsoft browser
- Enable multi-identity use and app-level conditional access
- Apply data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device
- Enable app protection without requiring enrollment
- Enable app protection on devices managed with 3rd party EMM tools

> [!NOTE]
> For your client line-of-business apps, you can incorporate mobile app management using the [Intune App Software Development Kit](app-sdk.md) (SDK), or the [App Wrapping Tool for iOS](app-wrapper-prepare-ios.md) and the [App Wrapping Tool for Android](app-wrapper-prepare-android.md).
