## Intune in the Azure portal

<!-- 1803 start -->

#### Multiple Exchange Connector support <!-- 2070451 -->

You'll no longer be limited to one Microsoft Intune Exchange Connector per tenant. Intune will support multiple Exchange Connectors so that you can set up Intune conditional access with multiple on-premises Exchange organizations.

With an Intune on-premises Exchange connector, you can manage device access to your on-premises Exchange mailboxes based on whether a device is enrolled in Intune and complies with Intune device compliance policies. To set up a connector, you download the Intune on-premises Exchange connector from the Azure portal and install it on a server in your Exchange organization. On the Microsoft Intune dashboard, choose **On-premises access**, and then under **Setup**, choose **Exchange ActiveSync connector**. Download the Exchange on-premises connector and install it on a server in your Exchange organization. Now that you're no longer limited to one Exchange connector per tenant, if you have additional Exchange organizations, you can follow this same process to download and install a connector for each additional Exchange organization.

### Support coming for new Cisco AnyConnect client for iOS <!-- 1333708 -->

New VPN profiles created for Cisco AnyConnect for iOS will work with Cisco AnyConnect 4.0.7x and higher. Existing iOS Cisco AnyConnect VPN profiles will be labeled **Cisco Legacy AnyConnect** and will continue to work with Cisco AnyConnect 4.0.5x as they do today.

> [!NOTE]
> This change is only for iOS; there will continue to be only one Cisco AnyConnect option for Android, Android for Work, and macOS.

#### More information

You need to create a new iOS Cisco AnyConnect VPN profile to support the new app because the new Cisco AnyConnect app and Cisco Legacy AnyConnect app are separate apps. If you are managing the AnyConnect client in your environment, you need to deploy the new Cisco AnyConnect app as well. To complete an upgrade, you also need to delete your Cisco Legacy AnyConnect VPN profile and remove the Cisco Legacy AnyConnect app.

Network access control (NAC) integration will not work for the new AnyConnect client in the initial release. We are working with Cisco to provide NAC integration in a future Intune release.

### Ability to deploy required line-of-business (LOB) apps to All Users on Windows 10 Desktop devices <!-- 1627835 RS4 -->
Customers will be able to deploy required line-of-business Windows 10 apps to install in device contexts. This will enable these apps to be available to all users on the device. This is only applicable on Windows 10 Desktop devices.

### Company Portal enrollment improved <!-- 1874230-->
Users enrolling a device by using the Company Portal on Windows 10 build 1703 and up will be able to complete the first step of enrollment without leaving the app.

### Updating the Help and Feedback experience on Company Portal app for Android <!--1631531 -->

We'll be updating the Help and Feedback experience on the Company Portal app for Android to align with best practices for Android apps. We'll be updating the Company Portal app for Android over the next few months to divide the **Help and Feedback** menu item to distinct **Help** and **Send Feedback** menu items. The **Help** page will feature a **Frequently Asked Questions** section and **Email Support** button to lead end users to upload logs to Microsoft and send email to company support describing the issue. **Send Feedback** will lead the user through a standard Microsoft feedback submission, which will prompt the user to choose whether, "I like something," "I don't like something," or "I have an idea."

### Send diagnostic reports in Company Portal app for macOS <!-- 2216677-->

The Company Portal app for macOS devices is being updated to improve how users report Intune-related errors. From the Company Portal app, your employees will be able to:

- Upload diagnostic reports directly to the Microsoft developer team.
- Email an incident ID to your company's IT support team.

### Edge mobile support for Intune app protection policies <!-- 1817882 -->

The Microsoft Edge browser for mobile devices will support app protection policies defined in Intune.

<!-- 1802 start -->

### New enrollment failure trend chart and failure reasons table <!-- 1471783 -->

On the Enrollment Overview page, you will be able to view the trend of enrollment failures and the top five causes of failures. By clicking on the chart or table, you will be able to drill into details to find troubleshooting advice and remediation suggestions.

### New Windows Defender Credential Guard settings added to endpoint protection settings <!--1102252 -->

New [Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/access-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard] settings will be added to **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Endpoint protection**. The following settings will be added:

- Platform Security Level: specify whether Platform Security Level is enabled at the next reboot. Virtualization-based security requires Secure Boot. Virtualization-based security can optionally be enabled with the use of direct memory access (DMA) protections. DMA protections require hardware support and will only be enabled on correctly configured devices.
- Virtualization Based Security: specify whether virtualization-based security is enabled at the next reboot.
- Windows Defender Credential Guard: turn on Credential Guard with virtualization-based security to help protect credentials at the next reboot when Platform Security Level with Secure Boot and Virtualization Based Security are both enabled. Options available include **Disabled**, **Enabled with UEFI lock**, **Enabled without lock**, and **Not configured**.
  - The "Disabled" option turns off Credential Guard remotely if it was previously turned on with the "Enabled without lock" option.

  - The "Enabled with UEFI lock" option ensures that Credential Guard cannot be disabled with registry key or by using Group Policy. To disable Credential Guard after using this setting, you must set the Group Policy to "Disabled" and remove the security functionality from each computer, with a physically present user, in order to clear configuration persisted in UEFI. As long as the UEFI configuration persists Credential Guard is enabled.

  - The "Enabled without lock" option allows Credential Guard to be disabled remotely by using Group Policy. The devices that use this setting must be running at least Windows 10 (Version 1511).

  - The "Not Configured" option leaves the policy setting undefined. Group Policy does not write the policy setting to the registry, and so it has no impact on computers or users. If there is a current setting in the registry it will not be modified.

### New printer settings for education profiles <!-- 1308900 -->

For education profiles, new settings will be available under the **Printers** category: **Printers**, **Default printer**, **Add new printers**.

### iOS app provisioning configuration <!-- 1581650 -->
You will be able to assign iOS app provisioning profiles to prevent your apps from expiring by including or excluding security groups.

<!-- the following are present prior to 1801 -->

### App Protection Policies  <!-- 679615 -->
Intune App Protection Policies will offer the ability to create global, default policies to quickly enable protection across all users in the entire tenant.

### Configure an iOS app PIN <!-- 1586774 -->
Soon you will be able to require a PIN for targeted iOS apps. You can configure the PIN requirement and expiration date in days through the Azure portal. When required, a user will be required to set and use a new PIN before getting access to an iOS app. Only iOS apps that have app protection enabled with the Intune App SDK will support this feature.

<!-- the following are present prior to 1711 -->

### Azure Active Directory web sites can require the Intune Managed Browser App and support Single Sign-On for the Managed Browser (Public Preview) <!-- 710595 -->   
Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you will be able to restrict access to web sites on mobile devices to the Intune Managed Browser app. In the managed browser, web site data will remain secure and separate from end-user personal data. In addition, the Managed Browser will support Single Sign-On capabilities for sites protected by Azure AD. Signing in to the Managed Browser, or using the Managed Browser on a device with another app managed by Intune, allows the Managed Browser to access corporate sites protected by Azure AD without the user having to enter their credentials. This functionality applies to sites like Outlook Web Access (OWA) and SharePoint Online, as well as other corporate sites like intranet resources accessed through the Azure App Proxy.

<!-- the following are present prior to 1711 -->

### Redirecting macOS users to the new Company Portal app <!--1380728-->   
When an end user logs into the Company Portal website to enroll their macOS device, they will be directed to download the new Company Portal app for macOS to complete the process. This occurs for macOS devices using OS X El Capitan 10.11 or above.Â
