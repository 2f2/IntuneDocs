# Manage volume-purchased apps with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Some app stores give you the ability to purchase multiple licenses for an app that you want to run in your company. Buying licenses in bulk can help you reduce the administrative overhead of tracking multiple purchased copies of apps.

Microsoft Intune helps you manage apps that you purchased through such a program. You can import license information from the app store, track how many licenses you have used, and ensure you don't install more copies of the app than you own.

## Which types of apps can you manage?

With Intune, you can manage apps that you purchased in volume from the iOS app store, and the Windows Store for Business. To discover how to manage licensed apps from each store, choose one of the following topics:

[Manage iOS volume-purchased apps](vpp-apps-ios.md)
[Manage volume-purchased apps from the Windows Store for Business](windows-store-for-business.md)
