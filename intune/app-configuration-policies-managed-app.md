# Add app configuration policies for managed apps without device enrollment

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

You can use app configuration policies with managed apps that support the Intune App SDK even on devices that are not enrolled. 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** + **Intune**.
3. Choose the **Mobile apps** workload.
4. Click **App configuration policies** in the **Manage** group, and then click **Add**.
5. Set the following details:
    - **Name**  
      The name of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Description**  
      The  description of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Device enrollment type**  
      Choose **Manage apps**.
6. Select **Associated app** to choose the app that you are going to configure. Select the app from the list of apps that you have approved and synchronized with Intune.
7. For each configuration setting supported by the app, type the **Name** and **Value**, and click the ellipse (**…**).  
    To delete a configuration, click the ellipse (**…**), and select **Delete**.  
    Intune App SDK-enabled apps support configurations in key-value pairs. Consult the documentation for each app to learn more about which key-value configurations are supported.  
    In addition, you can use tokens that will be dynamically populated with data generated by the application.

## Configuration values using tokens

Certain tokens can be generated and sent to the managed application by Intune. For example if your app configuration can use an email setting, you can add a dynamic email by using a token. Type the name expected by the app in the **Name** field, and then type `\{\{mail\}\}` in the **Value** field.

Intune supports the following token types in the configuration settings:

- \{\{userprincipalname\}\} - (Example: **John@contoso.com**)
- \{\{mail\}\} - (Example: **John@contoso.com**)
- \{\{partialupn\}\} - (Example: **John**)
- \{\{accountid\}\} - (Example: **fc0dc142-71d8-4b12-bbea-bae2a8514c81**)
- \{\{deviceid\}\} - (Example: **b9841cd9-9843-405f-be28-b2265c59ef97**)
- \{\{userid\}\} - (Example: **3ec2c00f-b125-4519-acf0-302ac3761822**)
- \{\{username\}\} - (Example: **John Doe**)
- \{\{PrimarySMTPAddress\}\} - (Example: testuser@ad.domain.com) 


> [!Note]  
> The \{\{ and \}\} characters are used by token types only and must not be used for other purposes.

## Next steps

Continue to [assign](apps-deploy.md) and [monitor](apps-monitor.md) the app as usual.
