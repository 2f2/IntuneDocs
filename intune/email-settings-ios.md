# Email profile settings for iOS devices - Intune

Use the email profile settings to configure your devices running iOS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We’re making some improvements to the S/MIME feature described in this article. As a result, the S/MIME feature is temporarily removed in Intune. When this feature is released, we’ll remove this note.

## Email settings

- **Email server**: Enter the host name of your Exchange server.
- **Account name**: Enter the display name for the email account. This name is shown to users on their devices.
- **Username attribute from AAD**: This name is the attribute Intune gets from Azure Active Directory (AAD). Intune dynamically generates the username that's used by this profile. Your options:
  - **User Principal Name**: Gets the name, such as `user1` or `user1@contoso.com`
  - **Primary SMTP address**: Gets the name in email address format, such as `user1@contoso.com`
  - **sAM Account Name**: Requires the domain, such as `domain\user1`.

    Also enter:  
    - **User domain name source**: Choose **AAD** (Azure Active Directory) or **Custom**.

      When choosing to get the attributes from **AAD**, enter:
      - **User domain name attribute from AAD**: Choose to get the **Full domain name** or the **NetBIOS name** attribute of the user

      When choosing to use **Custom** attributes, enter:
      - **Custom domain name to use**: Enter a value that Intune uses for the domain name, such as `contoso.com` or `contoso`

- **Email address attribute from AAD**: Choose how the email address for the user is generated. Select **User principal name** (`user1@contoso.com` or `user1`) to use the full principal name as the email address. Select **Primary SMTP address** (`user1@contoso.com`) to use the primary SMTP address to sign in to Exchange.
- **Authentication method**: Select either **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile. Azure multi-factor authentication isn't supported.
  - If you selected **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created that is used to authenticate the Exchange connection.
- **SSL**: **Enable** uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.
- **OAuth**: **Enable** uses Open Authorization (OAuth) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with Exchange. When using OAuth, be sure to:

  - Confirm your email solution supports OAuth before targeting this profile to your users. Office 365 Exchange online support OAuth. On-premises Exchange and other partner or third-party solutions may not support OAuth. On-premises Exchange can be configured for Modern Authentication (see the [Announcing Hybrid Modern Authentication for Exchange On-Premises](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2017/12/06/announcing-hybrid-modern-authentication-for-exchange-on-premises/) blog post).

    If the email profile uses Oauth, and the email service doesn't support it, then the **Re-Enter password** option appears broken. For example, nothing happens when the user selects **Re-Enter password** in Apple's device settings.

  - When OAuth is enabled, end users have a different “Modern Authentication” email sign-in experience that supports multi-factor authentication (MFA). The [Mobile Iron blog](https://www.mobileiron.com/blog/ios-12-what-enterprises-oauth-know) provides details on the user experience on iOS 12 devices.

  - Some organizations disable the end user’s ability to do [self-service application access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-self-service-access). In this scenario, the Modern Authentication sign-in may fail until an Administrator creates the “iOS Accounts” enterprise app, and grant users access to the app in Azure AD.

    The default action is to add an application using the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) **Add App** feature **without business approval**. For more information, see [assign users to applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/ways-users-get-assigned-to-applications).

  > [NOTE]
  > When you enable OAuth, the following happens:  
  > 1. Devices that are already targeted are issued a new profile.
  > 2. End users are prompted to enter their credentials again.

- **S/MIME**: **Enable S/MIME** to send outgoing email using S/MIME signing. When enabled, you can also encrypt email to recipients who can receive encrypted email, and decrypt email received from senders.
  - If you select **Certificate**, choose an existing PKCS certificate profile to authenticate the Exchange connection, and/or encrypt email exchanges.
- **Amount of email to synchronize**: Choose the number of days of email that you want to synchronize. Or select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Allow messages to be moved to other email accounts**: **Enable** allows users to move email messages between different accounts the users configured on their devices.
- **Allow email to be sent from third-party applications**: **Enable** allows users to select this profile as the default account for sending email. It allows third-party applications to open email in the native email app, such as attaching files to email.
- **Synchronize recently used email addresses**: **Enable** allows users to synchronize the list of email addresses that have been recently used on the device with the server.
