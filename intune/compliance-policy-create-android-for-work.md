# Add a device compliance policy for Android Enterprise devices in Intune

Device compliance policies are a key feature when using Intune to protect your organization's resources. In Intune, you can create rules and settings that devices must meet to be considered compliant, such as a password length. If the device isn't compliant, you can then block access to data and resources using [conditional access](conditional-access.md). 

You can also get device reports, and take actions for non-compliance, such as sending a notification email to the user. To learn more about compliance policies, and any prerequisites, see [get started with device compliance](device-compliance-get-started.md).

This article lists the settings you can use within a compliance policy for devices running Android Enterprise.

## Non-compliance and conditional access

The following table describes how noncompliant settings are managed when a compliance policy is used with a conditional access policy.

--------------------------

|**policy setting**| **Android Enterprise profile** |
| --- | --- |
| **PIN or password configuration** |  Quarantined |
| **Device encryption** |  Quarantined |
| **Jailbroken or rooted device** | Quarantined (not a setting) |
| **email profile** | Not applicable |
| **Minimum OS version** | Quarantined |
| **Maximum OS version** | Quarantined |
| **Windows health attestation** |Not applicable |

**Remediated** = The device operating system enforces compliance. For example, the user is forced to set a PIN.

**Quarantined** = The device operating system doesn't enforce compliance. For example, Android devices don't force the user to encrypt the device. When the device isn't compliant, the following actions take place:

  - If a conditional access policy applies to the user, the device is blocked.
  - The company portal notifies the user about any compliance problems.

## Create a device compliance policy

[!INCLUDE [new-device-compliance-policy](./includes/new-device-compliance-policy.md)]
4. For **Platform**, select **Android enterprise**. 
5. Choose **Settings Configure**. Enter the **Device Health**, **Device Properties**, and **System Security** settings, as described in this article.

## Device health

- **Rooted devices**: Choose **Block** to mark rooted (jailbroken) devices as not compliant. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
- **Require the device to be at or under the Device Threat Level**: Use this setting to take the risk assessment from the Lookout MTP solution as a condition for compliance. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. To use this setting, choose the allowed threat level:
  - **Secured**: This option is the most secure, and means that the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected with any level of threats, it's evaluated as noncompliant.
  - **Low**: The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a noncompliant status.
  - **Medium**: The device is evaluated as compliant if the threats that are present on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, it's determined to be noncompliant.
  - **High**: This option is the least secure, as it allows all threat levels. It may be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes.
- **Google Play Services is configured**: **Require** that the Google Play services app is installed and enabled. Google Play services allows security updates, and is a base-level dependency for many security features on certified-Google devices. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
- **Up-to-date security provider**: **Require** that an up-to-date security provider can protect a device from known vulnerabilities. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
- **SafetyNet device attestation**: Enter the level of [SafetyNet attestation](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation.html) that must be met. Your options:
  - **Not configured** (default): Setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
  - **Check basic integrity**
  - **Check basic integrity & certified devices**

#### Threat scan on apps

On Android Enterprise devices, the **Threat scan on apps** setting is a configuration policy. See [Android Enterprise device restriction settings](device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

## Device properties settings

- **Minimum OS version**: When a device doesn't meet the minimum OS version requirement, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is displayed. The end user can choose to upgrade their device, and then access company resources.
- **Maximum OS version**: When a device is using an OS version later than the version in the rule, access to company resources is blocked. And, the user is asked to contact their IT admin. Until a rule is changed to allow the OS version, this device can't access company resources.

## System security settings

### Password

- **Require a password to unlock mobile devices**: **Require** users to enter a password before they can access their device. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. This setting is applied at the device level. If you only need to require a password at the work profile level then use a configuration policy, see [Android Enterprise Device Setting](device-restrictions-android-for-work.md)
- **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum number of digits or characters the user's password must have.
- **Required password type**: Choose if a password should include only numeric characters, or a mix of numerals and other characters. Your options:
  - **Device Default**
  - **Low security biometric**
  - **At least numeric** (default)
  - **Numeric complex**
  - **At least alphabetic**
  - **At least alphanumeric**
  - **At least alphanumeric with symbols**

- **Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required**: Enter the idle time before the user must reenter their password. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
- **Password expiration (days)**: Select the number of days before the password expires, and they must create a new one.
- **Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse**: Enter the number of recent passwords that can't be reused. Use this setting to restrict the user from creating previously used passwords.

### Encryption

- **Encryption of data storage on device**: Choose **Require** to encrypt data storage on your devices. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. 

  You don't have to configure this setting because Android work profile devices enforce encryption.

### Device Security

- **Block apps from unknown sources**: Choose to **block** devices with "Security > Unknown Sources" enabled sources (supported on Android 4.0 â€“ Android 7.x; not supported by Android 8.0 and later). When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.

  To side-load apps, unknown sources must be allowed. If you're not side-loading Android apps, then set this feature to **Block** to enable this compliance policy. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Side-loading applications require that the **Block apps from unknown sources** setting is enabled. Enforce this compliance policy only if you're not side-loading Android apps on devices.

  You don't have to configure this setting as Android work profile devices always restrict installation from unknown sources.

- **Company portal app runtime integrity**: Choose **Require** to confirm the Company Portal app meets all the following requirements:

  - Has the default runtime environment installed
  - Is properly signed
  - Isn't in debug-mode
  - Is installed from a known source

  When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.

- **Block USB debugging on device**: Choose **Block** to prevent devices from using the USB debugging feature. When you choose **Not configured** (default), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.

  You don't have to configure this setting because USB debugging is already disabled on Android work profile devices.

- **Minimum security patch level**: Select the oldest security patch level a device can have. Devices that aren't at least at this patch level are noncompliant. The date must be entered in the *YYYY-MM-DD* format.

When done, select **OK** > **OK** to save your changes.

## Actions for noncompliance

Select **Actions for noncompliance**. The default action marks the device as noncompliant immediately.

You can change the schedule when the device is marked non-compliant, such as after one day. You can also configure a second action that sends an email to the user when the device isn't compliant.

[Add actions for noncompliant devices](actions-for-noncompliance.md) provides more information, including creating a notification email to your users.

## Scope tags

Scope tags are a great way to assign policies to specific groups, such as Sales, Engineering, HR, and so on. You can add a scope tags to compliance policies. See [Use scope tags to filter policies](scope-tags.md). 

## Assign user groups

Once a policy is created, it's not doing anything until you assign the policy. To assign the policy: 

1. Choose a policy that you've configured. Existing policies are in **Device compliance** > **Policies**.
2. Choose the policy, and choose **Assignments**. You can include or exclude Azure Active Directory (AD) security groups.
3. Choose **Selected groups** to see your Azure AD security groups. Select the user groups you want this policy to apply, and choose **Save** to deploy the policy to users.

You've applied the policy to users. The devices used by the users targeted by the policy are evaluated for compliance.
