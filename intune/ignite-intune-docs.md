# Microsoft Intune documentation - Ignite special edition

Welcome to Microsoft Ignite 2018! We're so glad you came to see us. While here at Microsoft Ignite 2018, check out some of the Intune resources we put together for you.

## Try our hands-on labs at Ignite!

Do we want to have a link for feedback? There will be one at the end of the lab that they will share with us. I think maybe we should cut the next line?:
