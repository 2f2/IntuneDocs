# Remove SCEP and PKCS certificates in Microsoft Intune

In Microsoft Intune, you can add SCEP and PKCS certificates to devices. These certificates can also be removed when you [wipe](devices-wipe.md#wipe) or [retire](devices-wipe.md#retire) the device. There are some other scenarios where certificates are automatically removed, and some scenarios where certificates stay on the device.

This article lists some common scenarios, and the impact on PKCS and SCEP certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> To remove and revoke certificates for a user that's being removed from Active Directory (AD) or Azure AD, be sure to follow the steps in order:
>
>    1. Wipe or retire the user's device
>    2. Remove the user from AD or Azure AD
