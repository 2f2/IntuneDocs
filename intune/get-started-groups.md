Microsoft Intune uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to [manage access to company resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-manage-groups). This access is controlled using roles in the directory. Intune then manages this access for mobile devices, which allows members of that group to access resources.

## How do I create a group?

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Using **Search resources**, search for **Users and groups**.
3. Once you've opened the **Users and groups** blade, select **All groups**.
4. On the **Users and groups â€“ All groups** blade, select the **New group** command.
5. On the **Group** blade, add a **Name** and **Description** for the group.
6. Set the **Membership type** as **Assigned**. Do not **Enable Office features** for the test group.
7. Click **Create**.

If you've successfully created a group, it should appear in the list of **All groups**. If it doesn't appear there, try to create another group.
