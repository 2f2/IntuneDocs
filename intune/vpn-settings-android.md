# Configure VPN settings for devices running Android in Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article shows you the Intune settings you can use to configure VPN connections on devices running Android.

You can configure VPN settings for the following platforms:

- [Android](#android-vpn-settings)
- [Android for work](#android-for-work-vpn-settings)

Depending on the settings you choose, not all the following values are configurable.

## Android VPN settings

- **Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection. End users see this name when they browse their device for the available VPN connections.
- **IP address or FQDN**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the VPN server that devices connect. For example, enter **192.168.1.1** or **vpn.contoso.com**.

  - **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server. Your options:

    - **Certificates**: Select an existing SCEP or PKCS certificate profile to authenticate the connection. [Configure certificates](certificates-configure.md) lists the steps to create a certificate profile.
    - **Username and password**: When signing into the VPN server, end users are prompted to enter a user name and password.

- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type. Your options:

  - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
  - **Cisco AnyConnect**
  - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
  - **F5 Edge Client**
  - **Pulse Secure**
  - **Citrix**

- **Fingerprint** (Check Point Capsule VPN only): Enter a string, such as **Contoso Fingerprint Code**, to verify that the VPN server can be trusted. A fingerprint can be sent to the client so it knows to trust any server that has the same fingerprint when connecting. If the device doesnâ€™t have the fingerprint, it prompts the user to trust the VPN server while showing the fingerprint. The user manually verifies the fingerprint, and chooses trust to connect.
- **Enter key and value pairs for the Citrix VPN attributes** (Citrix only): Enter key and value pairs, provided by Citrix. These values configure the properties of the VPN connection.

## Android for work VPN settings

- **Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection. End users see this name when they browse their device for the available VPN connections.
- **IP address or FQDN**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the VPN server that devices connect. For example, enter **192.168.1.1** or **vpn.contoso.com**.

  - **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server. Your options:
  
    - **Certificates**: Select an existing SCEP or PKCS certificate profile to authenticate the connection. [Configure certificates](certificates-configure.md) lists the steps to create a certificate profile.
    - **Username and password**: When signing into the VPN server, end users are prompted to enter a user name and password.

- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type. Your options:

  - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
  - **Cisco AnyConnect**
