# Intune Deployment Planning, Design and Implementation Guide

[!INCLUDE[note for both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

A successful Intune deployment starts with having a good plan and design. The purpose of this guide is to step you through the process of developing a deployment plan, creating a design, onboarding Intune, and conducting a production rollout.

## What’s included in this guide?

This guide includes sections that will walk you through the end to end process of deploying Intune. Sections 2 – 7 are not intended to be worked on sequentially, and should be completed in parallel.

-   [Section 1: Determine deployment goals, objectives and challenges](planning-guide-deployment-goals.md)

-   [Section 2: Identify use case scenarios](planning-guide-scenarios.md)

-   [Section 3: Determine use case requirements](planning-guide-requirements.md)

-   [Section 4: Develop a rollout plan](planning-guide-rollout-plan.md)

-   [Section 5: Develop a rollout communication plan](planning-guide-communication-plan.md)

-   [Section 6: Develop a support plan](planning-guide-support-plan.md)

-   [Section 7: Create an Intune design](planning-guide-design.md)

-   [Section 8: Intune implementation](planning-guide-onboarding.md)

-   [Section 9: Testing and validation](planning-guide-test-validation.md)

This guide also provides additional technical information and table templates that can be used to assist you with the Intune deployment planning, design and implementation process.

-   [Additional resources: Links and table templates](planning-guide-resources.md)

## Assumptions

-   You've already evaluated Intune in a proof of concept (PoC) environment, and have decided to use it as the mobile device management solution in your organization.

-   You are already familiar with Intune and its features.

>[!NOTE]
> Check the [Intune evaluation guide](/intune-classic/understand-explore/sign-up-for-30-day-trial-microsoft-intune), if you want to get more familiar with Intune and its capabilities.

## Next steps

Let’s get started with the first section: [Determine deployment goals, objectives and challenges](planning-guide-deployment-goals.md).
