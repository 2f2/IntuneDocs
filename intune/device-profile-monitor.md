You can monitor the assignment progress of Intune device profiles in two ways:


1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **More Services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** section.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Device configuration**.
2. On the **Device configuration** blade under the **Manage** section, choose **Profiles**.
2. In the list of profiles blade, choose the profile you want to manage, and then, either:
	- On the <*profile name*> **Device configuration profile** blade, choose **Overview** to see basic information about the profile and its assignments.
	- On the <*profile name*> **Device configuration profile** blade, choose **Assignments** to see more detailed information about the profile and its assignments.
