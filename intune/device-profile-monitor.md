3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Device configuration**.
2. On the **Device configuration** blade under the **Manage** section, choose **Profiles**.
2. In the list of profiles blade, choose the profile you want to manage, and then, either:
	- On the <*profile name*> **Device configuration profile** blade, choose **Overview** to see basic information about the profile and its assignments.
