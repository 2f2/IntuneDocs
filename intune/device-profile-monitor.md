You can monitor the assignment progress of Intune device profiles in two ways.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** section.
3. In the **Intune** pane, select **Device configuration**.
4. In the **Device configuration** pane, in the **Manage** section, select **Profiles**.
5. In the pane that shows the list of profiles, select the profile that you want to manage. Then, do one of the following:
	- In the <*profile name*> **Device configuration profile** pane, to see basic information about the profile and its assignments, select **Overview**.
	- In the <*profile name*> **Device configuration profile** pane, to see more detailed information about the profile and its assignments, select **Assignments**.
