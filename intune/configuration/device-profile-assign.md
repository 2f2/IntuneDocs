# Assign user and device profiles in Microsoft Intune

You create a profile, and it includes all the settings you entered. The next step is to deploy or "assign" the profile to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user or device groups. When it's assigned, the users and devices receive your profile, and the settings you entered are applied.

This article shows you how to assign a profile, and includes some information on using scope tags on your profiles.

> [!NOTE]  
> When a policy is removed or no longer assigned to a device, the setting might keep the existing value. The setting doesn't revert to a default value. To change the setting to a different value, create a new policy and assign it.

## Before you begin

Be sure you have the appropriate role to assign policies. For more information, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

## Assign a device profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**. All the profiles are listed.
3. Select the profile you want to assign > **Assignments**.
4. Choose to **Include** groups or **Exclude** groups, and then select your groups. When you select your groups, you're choosing an Azure AD group. To select multiple groups, hold down the **Ctrl** key, and select your groups.

5. **Save** your changes.

### Evaluate how many users are targeted

When you assign the profile, you can also **Evaluate** how many users are affected. This feature calculates users; it doesn't calculate devices.

1. In the admin center, select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**.
2. Select a profile > **Assignments** > **Evaluate**. A message shows you how many users are targeted by this profile.

If the **Evaluate** button is grayed out, make sure the profile is assigned to one or more groups.

## Use scope tags or applicability rules

When you create or update a profile, you can also add scope tags and applicability rules to the profile.

**Scope tags** are a great way to assign and filter policies to specific groups, such as Human Resources or All US-NC employees. [Use RBAC and scope tags for distributed IT](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md) has more information.

On Windows 10 devices, you can add **applicability rules** so the profile only applies to a specific OS version or a specific Windows edition. [Applicability rules](device-profile-create.md#applicability-rules) has more information.

## User groups vs. device groups

Many users ask when to use user groups and when to use device groups. The answer depends on your goal. Here's some guidance to get you started.

### Device groups

If you want to apply settings on a device, regardless of who's signed in, then assign your policies to a devices group. These settings always go with the device.

Device groups are also ideal for devices that don't have a user. For example, you have devices that print tickets, scan tickets, used for inventory, and so on. In this scenario, put these devices in a devices group, and assign your policies to this devices group.

In Intune, you can create a [Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profile](device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md) that updates settings in the BIOS. For example, use this profile to disable the device camera, or lock down the boot options to prevent users from booting up another OS. This profile is a good scenario to assign to a devices group.

To summarize, use device groups when you don't care who's signed in on the device, or if anyone is signed in. You want your settings to always be on the device.

### User groups

Policy settings applied to user groups always go with the user, and go with the user when signed in to multiple devices. Itâ€™s normal for a user to have multiple devices, such as a Surface Pro for work, and a personal iOS device. And, it's normal for a person to access organizational resources from these multiple devices.

For example:

- You want to put a Help Desk icon for all users on all their devices. In this scenario, put these users in a users group, and assign your policy to this users group.
- A user receives a new organization-owned device. The user signs in to the device with their domain account. The device is automatically registered in Azure AD, and automatically managed by Intune. In this scenario, assign your enrollment policies to a users group.
- Whenever a user signs in to a device, you want to control features in apps, such as OneDrive and Teams. In this scenario, assign your OneDrive profile settings to a users group.

To summarize, use user groups when you want your settings and rules to always go with the user.

## Exclude groups from a profile assignment

Intune device configuration profiles let you include and exclude groups from policy assignment.

As a best practice, create and assign policies specifically for your user groups. And, create and assign different policies specifically for your device groups. For more information on groups, see [Add groups to organize users and devices](../fundamentals/groups-add.md).

When you assign your policies, use the following table when including and excluding groups. A checkmark means that assignment is supported:

![Supported options include or exclude groups from a profile assignment](./media/device-profile-assign/include-exclude-user-device-groups.png)

### What you should know

- Exclusion takes precedence over inclusion in the following same group type scenarios:

  - Including user groups and excluding user groups
  - Including device groups and excluding device group

  For example, you assign a device profile to the **All corporate users** user group, but exclude members in the **Senior Management Staff** user group. Since both groups are user groups, **All corporate users** except the **Senior Management staff** get the policy.

- Intune doesn't evaluate user-to-device group relationships. If you assign policies to mixed groups, the results may not be what you want or expect.

  For example, you assign a device profile to the **All Users** user group, but exclude an **All personal devices** device group. In this mixed group policy assignment, **All users** get the policy. The exclusion does not apply.

  As a result, it's not recommended to assign policies to mixed groups.

## Next steps

See [monitor device profiles](device-profile-monitor.md) for guidance on monitoring your profiles, and the devices running your profiles.
