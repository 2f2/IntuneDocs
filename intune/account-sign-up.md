This topic tells system administrators how they can sign up for an Intune account.

Before you can sign in or sign up for Intune, you should determine whether your organization already has a Microsoft Online Services work or school account, or if your organization has an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement with Microsoft. A work or school account is provided when you sign a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft or subscribe to other Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365.

If you already have a work or school account, simply **sign in** with that account and add Intune to your subscription. Otherwise, you can **sign up** for a new account to use Intune for your organization.

>[!WARNING]
>If you sign up for a new account, you cannot later use an existing work or school account to manage your subscription or combine it with existing volume licensing agreements.

## How to sign up or sign in to Intune

1.  Visit the [Intune Sign up](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) page.

2.  On the **Sign up** page, sign in or sign up to manage a new subscription of Intune.

## Post sign up considerations
After you sign up for a new subscription, you receive an email message that contains your account information at the email address that you provided during the sign up process. This email confirms your subscription is active.

After completing the sign up process you are directed to the Office 365 admin center, used to add users and assign them licenses. If you only have cloud-based accounts using your default onmicrosoft.com domain name, then you can go ahead and add users and assign licenses at this point. However, if you plan to use your organization's [custom domain name](custom-domain-name-config.md) or want to [synchronize user account information](users-permissions-add.md#sync-active-directory-and-add-users-to-intune) from on-premises Active Directory, then you can close that browser window.
