title: Enroll devices in Microsoft Intune
Summary: Microsoft Intune lets you manage your workforce’s devices and apps and how they access your company data. To use this mobile device management (MDM), the devices must first be enrolled in the Intune service. When a device is enrolled, it is issued an MDM certificate. This certificate is used to communicate with the Intune service. There are several methods to enroll your workforce’s devices. Each method depends on the device's ownership (personal or corporate), device type (iOS, Windows, Android), and management requirements (resets, affinity, locking). By default, devices for all platforms are allowed to enroll in Intune. However, you can restrict devices by platform.
