# Intune actions and options supported with Apple User Enrollment

User Enrollment supports a subset of device management options. If a pre-existing configuration profile is applied to a User Enrollment device, only settings supported by User Enrollment will be applied to that device.

## Password settings

On User Enrollment devices, the Require password setting is the only supported option. If configured, the only restriction enforced is to require a 6-digit complex numeric PIN.

For example, you configure the Password expiration setting, and push this policy to User Enrollment devices. On such devices, the expiration is ignored and the password must be 6-digit, complex number.

## Administrator remote device actions and options
Admins can perform the following actions and options on User Enrollment devices:
- Retire
- Delete
- Remote Lock
- Sync

All other actions aren't supported.

## End-user actions
On User Enrollment devices, end users can perform these actions on their devices from the Company Portal application and website:
- Rename. This action applies only to the user-facing name within the Company Portal. It won’t fully rename the device outside of that context.
- Remove
- Remote Lock
- Check Status

## Other supported options

The following options are supported in Intune for devices enrolled by using Apple User enrollment:
- Per-App VPN. This support excludes Safari Domains as User Enrollment doesn't support configuring Safari settings.
- WiFi 
- Corporate app removal upon unenrollment
- App deployment via User-licensed Volume Purchasing Plan (VPP )
- Jailbreak Detection

The following restrictions are supported:
- View corporate documents in unmanaged apps
- Viewing non-corporate documents in corporate apps
- Allow unmanaged apps to read from managed contacts accounts
- AirDrop as an unmanaged destination
- Required encrypted backup
- Managed apps sync to cloud
- Control Center access while device locked
- Notification Center access while device locked
- Today view while device locked 

## Options not supported
The following options aren't supported on devices enrolled with User Enrollment. If you need these options, check out Device Enrollment for personally-owned devices or Automated Device Enrollment for corporate devices.
- Collect app inventory for apps outside of the managed APFS volume.
- Collect inventory of certificates and provisioning profiles outside of the managed APFS volume.
- Collect UDID and other persistent device identifiers.
- User Enrollment supports a unique enrollment ID for each device enrolled, but this ID doesn't persist after unenrollment.
- The following Intune features aren't supported because of this limitation:
- SCEP User profiles with Subject Name Format of Serial Numbe.r
- Device-level VPN.
- Device-licensed VPP app deployment.
- MDM control of applications outside of the managed APFS volume.
- Application Protection Policies will still apply to these apps. However, you won’t be able to take over management or deploy a managed version of these apps unless the user deletes them from their device.
- Actions, configurations, settings, and commands requiring supervision.
