# Microsoft apps you can use with Microsoft Intune mobile application management policies


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Microsoft Intune application partners](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/microsoft-intune/partners.aspx) page contains the latest information about apps from Microsoft and other companies that you can use with mobile application management policies and will, in future, replace this topic.

If you have devices that are not enrolled in Intune, see [Get started with mobile app management policies in the Azure portal](get-started-with-mobile-app-management-policies-in-the-azure-portal.md).
