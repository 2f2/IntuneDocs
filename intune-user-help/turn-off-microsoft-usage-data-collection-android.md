# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about our products and services. The data is used to improve the reliability and performance of our products, such as the Company Portal and Microsoft Intune app. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your company support does not have control over the collection of this data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.  

To turn off data collection on your Android device:  

1. Open the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Under **Usage data**, you'll see **Automatically send usage data to Microsoft**. Flip the switch to **No**.  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
