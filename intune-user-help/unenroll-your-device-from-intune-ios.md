# Unenroll your iOS device from Intune

When you unenroll your iOS device from Intune, your device will no longer be able to access company resources and will no longer be managed by Intune.

Use these steps to unenroll your device from Intune.


1.  In the Company Portal app, tap **Devices.** and select the device you want to unenroll. If you only have one device, when you tap **Devices**, you will go directly to the device details screen.

2.  Next to **RENAME** tap the ellipses button > **Remove Device** > **Remove**.
