# Email company support about app problem

If you experience a problem while using the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app, you can email the details of the problem to your company support person. These details will provide the context needed to troubleshoot the problem for you.  

The actual error details are kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. When you upload the logs to the Company Portal or Microsoft Inune app, they're first sent to the Microsoft developers that work on the app. They use the logs to improve the app's functionality and prevent future errors. An incident ID for your specific error is then provided to you to share with your company support person, for use in Microsoft Support cases.  

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to find the cause of the problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).  

To email your company support:  

1.  Open the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.

2.  Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3.  Tap **Send Email & Upload Logs**.
4.  After the upload is complete, tap your email app. An email message will open with the incident ID pre-populated in the subject field. In the body of the email, describe the problem that you encountered.  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
