# Turn on verbose logging

Turn on *verbose logging* to let the Company Portal app, Microsoft Intune app, and Intune-managed apps record your actions with these apps. If you ever experience and report app problems, your support team will review the logs for error details.  

Verbose logging is enabled on your device by default. The logs that you send to your support team will include your email address.  

To turn verbose logging on or off:
1. Sign in to the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.
2. Tap **Settings**.
3. Next to **Verbose Logging**, flip the switch to **On** or **Off**.  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
