# Send diagnostic details to your company support from Company Portal for Windows

Troubleshoot app problems in the Company Portal app for Windows 10. If you run into a problem while youâ€™re using the app on your Windows 10 device, you can email your support team for help. Events and errors that occur in the Company Portal app are saved on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. 

When you request help, the app opens a prepopulated email for you, with the diagnostic ID. Your company support can reference this ID if they need to view the logs.

> [!Note]		
> After you click **Get help**, the Company Portal will automatically send your logs to Microsoft's support team. This step is a proactive one that makes it easier to troubleshoot and resolve problems related to Microsoft.  

1. Open the **Company Portal** app.
2. Select **Help & support** > **Get help**.  

   ![Screenshot of the Help & support page, highlighting the left navigation bar and Get Help section.](./media/1812_UCP_Help_Support_Get_Help_Logs.png)    

3. When the **Share** screen appears, select **Mail**. The **Mail** app will create an email message for you. Type in a description of the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for in the logs.

If your company needs additional information about app or device activity, you might also need to send [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md).  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
