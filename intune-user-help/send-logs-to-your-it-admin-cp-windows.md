# Send diagnostic logs to your company support from Company Portal for Windows

Help your company support troubleshoot your device or app problems in the Company Portal app for Windows 10. If you get an error while youâ€™re using the app on your Windows 10 device, you can email your support team with details about your recent app activity. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

> [!Note]		
> After you click **Get help**, the Company Portal will automatically send your logs to Microsoft's support team. This is a proactive step that makes it easier to troubleshoot and resolve problems that are related to Microsoft.

1. Open the **Company Portal** app.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Select **Get help**. 
4. **Share** will open. Select **Mail**. This will create an email message with the Company Portal logs attached that can be sent to your company support.

   ![The Send Logs dialog from the Company Portal app's Settings page. The link to click says "Send logs - Send diagnostic logs to your company support to help them solve issues within the Company Portal."](./media/w10-share-logs-after-1711.png)

You might also need to send [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md) to give your company support additional information about your recent activity.  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
