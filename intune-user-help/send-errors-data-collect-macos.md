# Submit errors to the right people for your managed macOS device

Sometimes the Company Portal app may close unexpectedly. This is an issue that the app developers want to hear about, as it can help us make it work better for you and prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic report_.

If you get errors on your macOS device while using the Company Portal app, you can send information to help your company support troubleshoot the problem. You can send error information in different ways:

-   On error alert messages, click **Report**.

-   In the **Help** menu of the Company Portal app, click **Save Diagnostic Report**. You can email or upload this file to your company support, depending on your company.

- If your email app is already configured, you can also send the diagnostic report by going to **Help** > **Send Diagnostic Report**.

## Send logs to the Company Portal developers for macOS devices

If you need to send diagnostic reports to the Microsoft team that develops the Company Portal app, you'll need to provide some information to try and diagnose the root cause. Instead of sending it to your company support team, use <a href="mailto:IntuneCPiOSfeedback@microsoft.com?subject=My Company Portal App Closed Unexpectedly&body=Press and hold, then paste your copied Company Portal app logs here.">this email template</a> to send it to Microsoft.

## How to turn off Microsoft data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about our products and services. We do this to improve the reliability and performance of our products, including the Company Portal app. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your company support does not have control over the collection of this data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

If you wish to turn off the collection of usage data on your macOS device, open the Company Portal app, then select the **Company Portal** menu. Open **Preferences** and under **Send usage data to Microsoft**, uncheck the **Allow Microsoft to collect data** box.
