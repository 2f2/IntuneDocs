# Get recovery key for macOS device 
Get a recovery key for your macOS device from the Intune Company Portal website. If you forget your device password, you can use the recovery key to sign back in. 

This option is only available for devices that've been encrypted by your organization using FileVault. It's not available for devices that you've personally encrypted. 

1. Go to the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and select the **Menu** button > **Devices**.  
2. Select a device.
3. Select **Get recovery key**. If you don't see this option at the top of the page, select **More (â€¦)** > **Get recovery key**.  
4. Your recovery key will apppear. For security reasons, the key will disappear after five minutes. To see the key again, repeat step 3. 

If a key isn't found but your device is properly encrypted, contact your organization's support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
