Install apps on your device from the Company Portal app for Windows.

## Install apps

1. Open the Company Portal app and sign in with your work or school account.

2. Find and install apps from any of the following sections of the Company Portal app:  

    * **Home**: Select from a list of your organization's featured apps.  
    * **Show all**: From the **Home page** > **Apps** section, click **Show all** to view all available apps.  
    * **All apps**: Select this page in the navigation pane to see all available apps, including installed and featured.  
    * **Search for apps**: A static search bar sits in the app's navigation pane.  To find your available apps, search by app name or publisher.  
    * **All apps**: View, sort, and filter all available apps. Search results are sorted automatically by relevancy.  

3. Select an app.   
4. On the apps details page, click **Install**. After installation is done, you'll see an **Installed** status.

 Depending on the size of your company, you might see multiple versions of Office available to download from Company Portal. For specific information about the Office suite for Windows devices, see [Installing Office 365 on your Windows device](./install-office-windows.md).

## Share apps with others  
Share and recommend apps to your work or school contacts. The following steps describe how to share a link directly from Company Portal.

1. In Company Portal, right-click or press and hold on any app to open its [context menu](https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/menus).  

    ![The Company Portal app for Windows 10, front page, showing a list of Apps and devices. The clickable "Share" context menu is visible on top of the example app's icon. ](./media/1808_ShareContext_CP_Windows.png)  

2. Select **Share**.
3. Choose from individual contacts or select another program, such as OneNote, to send to a group. If you don't see an app you want to use, select **Get apps in Store** to see other available apps.  

    ![An example screenshot of the Company Portal app for Windows 10, Share pop-up page. Page says "Learn about <example app name> in the Company Portal app." It shows one contact and 2 apps to choose from to send the link, and a "Get apps in Store" link. ](./media/1808_ShareApps_CP_Windows.png) 

After you share, the recipient will receive a link and a message to view the app's details. The link opens the Company Portal **App details** page. 

## Available apps  

Your organization selects apps for you that they think are appropriate and useful at work or school. These apps are the only ones you'll find in the Company Portal.  

Apps are also made available to you based on your device type. For example, if you're using the Company Portal app for Windows, you'll have access to Windows apps, but not iOS apps.  

## Request an app for work or school  
If there's an app you need, but don't see in Company Portal, you can request it. Find contact details for your **Helpdesk** in the Company Portal app, on the help & support page. You'll also find them on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
