**If the installation doesn't work**

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, try installing Skycure manually from the Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout.enterprise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout.enterprise)
