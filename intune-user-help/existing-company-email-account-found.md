# An existing company email account was found

If you had access to your work email account from your mobile device *before* getting your device managed, we recommend that you:
* Disconnect the existing work email account from your device.
* Resync device settings from the Company Portal app.  

1.  On your device, go to **Settings** and find your connected accounts. Setting names will very across devices. For example:
 * On an iOS device, select **Password & Accounts**.
 * On an Android device, select **Cloud and accounts** > **Accounts**.
 * On a Windows device, select **Accounts** > **Email & accounts**.
 
2. Select and remove your work email account.

3. Open the Company Portal app on your device.  

4. Under your list of devices, select the device you want to update.

5. Select **Check device settings** or **Check access**, depending on your device's platform. Within a few moments, your device will sync your new email settings.

6. Sign in to your work or school email account.
