# Enroll your Android device in telecom expense management

Your organization may be using telecom expense management software to ensure that their data and voice plans are being used within acceptable limits. Once you have completed enrolling your device, you will then be prompted to select the best category for that device.

1. Select the appropriate option, and you will receive a notification to install the [__Datalert__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.memobox.databox) app from the Google Play Store. The Datalert app is how your organization can measure data usage. If your organization has configured the work or school enrollment option, you will be required to log in with your work or school account. If this hasn't been enabled, you will need to provide information such as your phone number and verify your device using a code to enroll into the Datalert service from the app.

Tap the __next__ arrow at the top right corner of the screen to proceed.

2. Provide your device's phone number.
