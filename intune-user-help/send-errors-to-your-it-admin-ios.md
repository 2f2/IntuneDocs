# Send errors to your IT admin for issues with your Windows 10 device

If you get errors on your Windows 10 device while using the Company Portal app, you can send information to help your IT admin troubleshoot the problem. You can send error information in different ways:

-   On error alert messages, tap **Report**.

-   On the **About** screen of the Company Portal app, tap **Send Diagnostic Report**.

-   In the Company Portal app, shake your device, then tap **Send Diagnostic Report** when the diagnostics alert appears. If the alert doesnâ€™t appear when you shake the device, open **Settings** > **Company Portal**, and make sure that the **Shake Gesture** option is on.

If you have trouble with this way of sending logs, you can also try to [send your IT admin logs using email](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-by-email-iOS.md).

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
