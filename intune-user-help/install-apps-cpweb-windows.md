# View list of all installed apps on your device
Visit the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) > **Installed Apps** page to view a list of all apps installed on your device. The page lists the following details about each app:

* Name: The mane of the app, with a link to the app's details page.
* Assignment type: The kind of app assignment. Your organization can either make an app available for you to install yourself, or they can require and install an app on your device automatically.  
* Publisher: The name of the developer or company that distributed the app. A publisher is typically a software vendor or your organization.  
* Date Published: The date that the app was made available to download. Publish date could show an app’s initial release, or an app’s most recent update.
* Status: The current installation status of the app on your device.  

Use **Sort By** to rearrange the apps by name, assignment type, publisher, or chronologically by publish date. Use **Filter By** to view only apps with a specfic status.
