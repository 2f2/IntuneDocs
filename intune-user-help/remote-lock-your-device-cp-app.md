# Lock your device from Company Portal app for Windows 10

Remotely lock a lost or stolen device from the Company Portal app for Windows 10. If supported on your device, the Company Portal app will lock your device's screen--no matter where it is. A passcode will be required to unlock it.

Remote lock is supported on:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 Mobile (if the device already had a passcode set)
* Windows Phone 8.1 (if the device already had a passcode set)

## Remotely lock your device

1. From the **Home** page of the Company Portal app, go to **My Devices** and select the device that you want to lock.

2. On the **Device details** page, select the **Remote lock** icon > **Remove**.

3. Select **Lock** to confirm that you want to lock the device.

A “Remote lock pending” message will appear while the Company Portal app tries to lock your device. You can monitor the status of the message in three places throughout the Company Portal app:

   * The notifications area of the app.
   * The **Device details** page of the specific device.
   * The **Home** page, next to **My Devices** > device name.

After your device has been succesfully locked, the message will change to "Remote lock successful." If you receive a “Remote lock failed” notification, wait a few minutes, and then try to lock your device again. The status will change back to “Remote lock pending.” If the retry fails again, contact your company support person.

Should you find your device, enter your passcode to unlock it.
