# Send logs to the Company Portal developers for Android devices

Sometimes the Company Portal app may close unexpectedly. This is an issue that the app developers want to hear about, as it can help us make it work better for you and prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to figure out the issue, you should turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging includes all relevant details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).

If this is happening to you, the Company Portal team needs the Company Portal logs to try and diagnose the root cause. To send logs to Microsoft:

1.  Open the Company Portal app.

2.  Tap **Menu** >  **Help and Feedback**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3.  Under **Feedback**, tap **Give Feedback**.

4.  Briefly describe the issue you are having in the email and tap **Send**.

You can also directly email the Company Portal team for Android at <a href="mailto:wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com?subject=Send logs to Microsoft&body=Describe the issue you are having.">wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com</a>.
