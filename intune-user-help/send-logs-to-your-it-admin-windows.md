# Enroll your Windows 10 device in Intune

If you get an error while youâ€™re using the Company Portal app on your Windows 10 device, you can help your IT admin troubleshoot the problem by sending them information through email. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

1.	Open the **Company Portal** app.
2.	Select **Settings** > **Send Logs**.
3.	**Share** will open. Select **Mail**. This will create an email message with the Company Portal logs attached that can be sent to your IT admin.

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
