# Use managed apps on your Android device
Managed apps are configured to meet your organization's security requirements, and protect work and school data. These apps are made available to you on your device to install or use automatically. 

Before you receive and install a managed app, your organization configures its permissions. They might restrict app functionality or user interactions to protect app data from being shared or seen by unauthorized individuals. For example, an organization could block the use of copy and paste while in the app. Or they could restrict you from saving data to your device's local storage.

To further protect files and data, your organization might configure several managed apps to work together. For example:
1. You connect to your organization's network in a managed browser app, such as Microsoft Edge.
2. You click a link to open your peer's presentation file.
3. An appropriate managed app, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, opens the file.

Organizations can require you to use a managed app to do something, such as open a work file, or access a web link. If you don't have the app, you might not be able to continue your task. Some managed apps are made available for you to install, but are not required.

## How do I know I'm using a managed app?
When you open data in a managed app, you receive a message similar to the example screenshot below.

## How do I get managed apps?
After you register you device with the Company Portal, you might notice that some managed apps are already installed on your device. To see if your organization has made other apps available to you:  
* Go to the Company Portal app or website to search, view, and install managed apps.
* Install an app from the Google Play store. Sign in to the app with your work or school account.

-   When your device is enrolled in Microsoft Intune, you either install the app from your Company Portal app or Company Portal website, or your company support might install it on your device. To learn about enrolling, see [Enroll your device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-Intune-android.md).

-   You install an app from the Play Store, and then sign in with your corporate user account that is managed by Intune.

## What can my company support manage in an app?
Here are some examples of options that your company support can manage in an app, and that can affect your interactions with company data on your device:

-   Access to specific websites

-   Transfers of data between apps

-   Saving files

-   Copy and paste operations

-   PIN access requirements

-   Your sign in, using company credentials

-   Ability to back up to the cloud

-   Ability to take screenshots

-   Data encryption requirements

Some common apps that your IT department might manage are:

-   Intune Managed Browser

-   Microsoft Azure Information Protection Viewer

-   Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

Contact your company support for more information about the managed apps on your device. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
