# Troubleshoot device enrollment in Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

This topic provides suggestions for troubleshooting device enrollment issues. If this information does not solve your problem, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/troubleshoot/how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune) to find more ways to get help.


## Initial troubleshooting steps

Before you begin troubleshooting, ensure that you configured Intune correctly to enable enrollment. See [Enroll Android and Standard Knox devices](/intune-azure/enroll-devices/enroll-android-and-knox-standard-devices.md) for links to enrollment steps for each platform.

Your managed device users can collect enrollment and diagnostic logs for you to review. User instructions for collecting logs are provided in:

- [Send Android enrollment errors to your IT admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enduser/send-enrollment-errors-to-your-it-admin-android)
- [Send iOS errors to your IT admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enduser/send-errors-to-your-it-admin-ios)
