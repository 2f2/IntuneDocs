# Add corporate identifiers

[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

As an IT admin you can create and import a comma-separated value (.csv) file that lists International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers to identify corporate-owned devices. Each IMEI number can have details specified in the list for administrative purposes.

<!-- When you upload serial numbers for company-owned iOS devices, they must be paired with a corporate enrollment profile. Devices must then be enrolled using either Apple’s device enrollment program (DEP) or Apple Configurator to have them appear as company-owned. -->

## Add corporate identifiers
To create the list, create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header. Add the IMEI identifier in the left column, and the details in the right column. Details are limited to 128 characters and are for administrative use only. Details aren't displayed on the device. The current limit is 500 rows per .csv file.

**Upload a .csv file that has serial numbers** – Create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header, and limit the list to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file.

|||
|-|-|
|&lt;IMEI #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|
|&lt;IMEI #2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|

This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:

```
01 234567 890123,device details
02 234567 890123,device details
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Android devices have multiple IMEI numbers. Intune inventories one IMEI number per device. If you import an IMEI number but it is not the IMEI inventoried by Intune, the device will be classified as a personal device instead of a company-owned device. If you import multiple IMEI numbers for a device, uninventoried numbers will display **Unknown** for enrollment status.

**To add a .csv list of corporate identifiers**

1. In the Azure portal, choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.

2. On the Intune blade, choose **Device enrollment** > **Enrollment Restrictions**, choose **Corporate Device Identifiers**, and then click **Add**.

3. In the **Add Identifiers** blade, specify the identifier type, **IMEI**. You can specify whether previously imported numbers should **Overwrite details for existing identifiers**.  

4. Click the folder icon and specify the path to the list you want to import. Navigate to the IMEI CSV file, and select **Add**.

Once imported, these devices might or might not be enrolled, and can have a state of either **Enrolled** or **Not contacted**. **Not contacted** means that the device has never communicated in with the Intune service.

## Delete  corporate identifiers

1. In the Azure portal, choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.

2. On the Intune blade, choose **Device enrollment** > **Enrollment Restrictions**, choose **Corporate Device Identifiers**, and choose **Delete**.

3. In the **Delete Identifiers** blade, brows to the .csv file of device IDs to delete, and then click **Delete**.
