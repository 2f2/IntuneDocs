# Reset Intune-managed devices to factory settings


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

The **Factory reset** returns a device to its default settings. The device will no longer be managed by Intune and both company and personal data are removed. You cannot undo this action.

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Devices**.
4. On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
5. From the list of devices you manage, choose a device, and then choose the **Factory reset** device remote action.

To see the status of the action you just took, on the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **Device Actions**.
