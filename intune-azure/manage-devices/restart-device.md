# Remotely restart devices with Intune


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

The **Restart** device action causes the device you choose to be restarted. The device owner is not automatically notified of the restart, therefore might lose work.

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Devices**.
4. on the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
5. From the list of devices you manage, choose a device, and then choose the **Restart** device remote action.

To see the status of the action you just took, on the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **Device Actions**.
