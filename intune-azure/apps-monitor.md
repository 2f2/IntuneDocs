# How to monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](./includes/azure_preview.md)]

Intune provides a number of ways in which you can monitor the properties of apps you manage, as well as their assignment status.

1. In the **Mobile Apps** workload, choose **Manage** > **Apps**.
2. In the list of apps blade, choose the app you want to see information for. You'll then see the <*app name*> **Device install status** blade:
![App install status blade.](./media/apps-monitor.png)

Then, take one of the following actions to learn more about your apps, and their assignments.

## General

- **Overview** - Provides a basic overview of the app, and information about the status of any assignments for that app. You can choose one of the charts to open the **Device install status** or **User install status** blades to get more detailed information.

## Manage

- **Properties** - Let's you view and change information about the selected app. For more information about app properties, see [How to add an app to Microsoft Intune](apps-add.md).
