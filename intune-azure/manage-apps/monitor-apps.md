You can monitor the assignment progress of Intune apps in two ways:

1. In the **Mobile Apps** workload, choose **Manage** > **All Apps**.
2. In the list of apps blade, choose the app you want, and then, either:
	- On the <*app name*> blade, choose **Overview** to see basic information about the app and it's assignments.
	- On the <*app name*> blade, choose **Reports** to see more detailed information about the app and its assignments.
