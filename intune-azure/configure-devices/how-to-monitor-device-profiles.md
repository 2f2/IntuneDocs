You can monitor the assignment progress of Intune device profiles in two ways:

1. In the **Device Configuration** workload, choose **Manage** > **Profiles**.
2. In the list of profiles blade, choose the profile you want to manage, and then, either:
- On the <*profile name*> **Reports** blade, choose **Overview** to see basic information about the profile and it's assignments.
- On the <*profile name*> **Reports** blade, choose **Reports** to see more detailed information about the profile and its assignments.
