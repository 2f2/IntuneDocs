# Configure device settings and features with Microsoft Intune


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

Use the Microsoft Intune **Device Configuration** workload to manage settings and features on all of the devices you manage. You can manage the following capabilities on your devices:

## Device restrictions
Description
For more information, see [](how-to-configure-device-restrictions.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows 10 and Windows 10 Team.

## Email
Email profiles let you create, deploy, and monitor Exchange ActiveSync email settings on devices you manage. By deploying these settings, you ensure consistency, reduce support calls, and let end users access company email on their personal devices without any required setup on their part.
For more information, see [](how-to-configure-email-settings.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10.

## Wi-Fi
Use Wi-Fi profiles to deploy wireless network settings to users and devices in your organization. When you deploy a Wi-Fi profile, your users will have access to your corporate Wi-Fi without having to configure it themselves.
For more information, see [](how-to-configure-wi-fi-settings.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS and Windows 8.1 (import only).

## VPN
Virtual private networks (VPNs) give your users secure remote access to your company network. Devices use a VPN connection profile to initiate a connection with the VPN server. Use VPN profiles to deploy VPN settings to users and devices in your organization, so they can easily and securely connect to the network.
