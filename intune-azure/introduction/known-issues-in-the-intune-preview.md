[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]


Use this topic to learn about any known issues in the Intune preview. If there's an issue you want to report, and it's not shown here, consider filing a report on our [Uservoice](https://microsoftintune.uservoice.com/forums/291681-ideas/category/189016-azure-admin-console) site.

## Administration and accounts

- Global Admins (also referred to as Tenant Admins) can continue to do day-to-day administration tasks without a separate Intune or Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) license. However, if Global Admins want to use the service, such as to enroll their own device, a corporate device, or use the Intune Company Portal, they will need an Intune or EMS license just like any other user.
