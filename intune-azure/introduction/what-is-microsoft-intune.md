# Introduction to Microsoft Intune in the Azure portal preview


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

Microsoft Intune is moving to the Azure portal and this means that the workflows and functionality you are used to will change.
The new portal offers you a preview of new and updated functionality in the Azure portal where you can manage your organization's mobile devices, PCs, and apps.
All Intune functionality will eventually move to Azure, but you can perform certain Intune tasks in the Azure portal today. Because this new experience is in preview, some functionality might not yet be present in the portal. Review the [What’s new in the preview](#what's-new-in-the-preview) section for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don’t see the new portal yet?**<br>
> We’ve already begun to roll out the preview to select tenants. Existing tenants will be migrated to the new experience starting in early calendar year 2017. You will receive a notification in the Office Message Center prior to your tenant’s migration. If you have any questions about the timeline for your tenant’s migration, contact our migration team at [intunegrps@microsoft.com](mailto:intunegrps@microsoft.com).


You'll find new product documentation in this library, and it will be continually updated during the preview. If you have suggestions you'd like to see, please leave feedback in the topic comments. We'd love to hear from you.

<!--- You can view the new Intune technical preview console in Azure at [portal.azure.com]. --->

Highlights of the new experience include:

- An integrated console for all your Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) components
- An HTML-based console built on web standards
- Microsoft Graph API support to automate many actions
- Azure Active Directory (AD) groups to provide compatibility across all your Azure applications
- Support for most modern web browsers

If you are looking for documentation for the classic Intune console, see [the Intune documentation library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/).

## Before you start

To use Intune in the Azure portal, you must have an Intune admin and tenant account. [Sign up for an account](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) if you don't already have one.

## Supported web browsers for the Azure portal

The Azure portal runs on most modern PCs, Macs, and tablets. Mobile phones are not supported.
Currently, the following browsers are supported:

- Microsoft Edge (latest version)
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11
- Safari (latest version, Mac only)
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)

Check the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-preview-portal-supported-browsers-devices) for the latest information about supported browsers.
