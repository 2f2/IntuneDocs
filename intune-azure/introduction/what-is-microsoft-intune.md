# Introduction to the Microsoft Intune preview


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

Welcome to the documentation for the public preview of the new admin experience for Microsoft Intune!

Highlights of the new experience include:

- An integrated console you'll use to manage all of your Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) components
- A standard admin console build on web standards
- Microsoft Graph API support for many actions
- Uses Azure AD groups instead of Intune groups to provide compatibility across all your applications

Because this new experience is in preview, some functionality from the existing console might not yet be present, so keep an eye on this page to find out when it is introduced.
Additionally, our product documentation is being constantly updated during the preview period. If you have any suggestions on documentation you'd like to see, please leave feedback in one of the topics in this library. We'd love to hear from you.


If you are looking for documentation for the existing Intune portal, see [the Intune Documentation Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/)
