# Role-based access control (RBAC) for Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

In simple terms, Intune **roles** (or RBAC) help you control who can perform various Intune actions, and who those actions apply to. You can either use the built-in roles that cover some common Intune scenarios, or you can create your own roles.

A role is defined by:

- **Definition** - The name of a role, and the permissions it configures.
- **Members** - The user, or group of users who will be given these permissions.
- **Scope** - The users or devices that a specified person (the member) can manage.
- **Assignment** - When the definition, members, and scope have been configured, the role is assigned.

## Built-in roles

The following roles are built into Intune and you can either customize these roles, or assign them to groups with no further configuration.

- **Intune Administrator** - Has full permissions for all Intune operations.
- **Application Manager** - Manage and deploy applications and profiles.
- **Configuration Policy Manager** - Manage and deploy configuration settings and profiles.
- **Helpdesk Operator** - Perform remote tasks and view user and device	information.
- **Read Only Operator** - View information in the Intune portal without the ability to make changes.


## Custom roles

If none of the built-in roles suit your needs, you can create your own role by choosing settings that span many of the capabilities of Intune. You can see a list of the available settings later in this topic.

### Example

You hire a new IT admin who will be in charge of deploying and managing apps to users in your London office. The users are in an Azure AD group named **London**. You want to ensure the IT admin cannot deploy apps to users in any other office. You take the following actions:

- Assign the built-in **Application Manager** role with the following properties:
	- **Members** - Select a group that contains the IT admin who will be deploying apps
	- **Scope** - Select the **London** Azure AD group.

	>[!IMPORTANT]
	>To create, edit, or assign roles, your account must have one of the following permissions in Azure AD:
	>- **Global AAD Admin**
	>- **Intune Service Admin**

### How to create a custom role

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Access control**.

## How to assign a role

2. On the <*role name*> - **Properties** blade, choose **Manage** > **Assignments**.
	>[!TIP]
	>On this blade, you can also edit or delete existing roles.
3. On the next blade, choose **Assign**.
4. On the **Role Assignments** blade, enter a **Name** and optional **Description** for the assignment, and then choose the following:
	- **Members** - Select a group that contains the user you want to give the permissions to.
	- **Scope** - Select a group containing the users who the member above will be allowed to manage.
5. When you are done, click **OK**.

The new assignment is displayed in the list of assignments.
