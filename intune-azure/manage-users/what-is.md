# What is the Microsoft Intune users and groups workload


[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](../includes/azure_preview.md)]

When you choose **Manage users**, you are taken to the Microsoft Azure Users and groups workload where you can perform the following actions

1. See overview information about the users and groups you manage.
2. See details about all users you manage with Azure.
3. Create groups of users and devices.
4. Display audit activity for group actions.

If you are new to Intune in the Azure portal, it's worth remembering that you no longer create Intune-specific groups. Intune now users Azure AD groups just like many other applications you use.
If you want to learn more about how to work with groups in Azure AD, see [Managing access to resources with Azure Active Directory groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-manage-groups)
