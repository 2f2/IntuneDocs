# Use full or selective wipe

[!INCLUDE[azure_preview](./includes/azure_preview.md)]

You can wipe apps and data from Intune-managed devices that are no longer needed, are being repurposed, or have gone missing. To do this, Intune provides selective wipe and full wipe capabilities. Users can also issue a remote device wipe command from the Intune Company Portal app on privately owned devices enrolled in Intune.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This topic is only about wiping devices managed by Intune mobile device management. You can also use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to [wipe company data from apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/wipe-managed-company-app-data-with-microsoft-intune). You can also [retire computers managed with the Intune client software](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/retire-a-windows-pc-with-microsoft-intune).

## Full wipe

**Full wipe** restores a device to its factory default settings, removing all company and user data and settings. The device is removed from Intune. Full wipe is useful for resetting a device before giving it to a new user, or for instances where the device has been lost or stolen.  **Be careful about selecting full wipe. Data on the device cannot be recovered**.


> [!Warning]
> Windows 10 RTM devices (devices earlier than the Windows 10 version 1511) with less than 4 GB of RAM might become inaccessible if wiped. To access a Windows 10 device that has become unresponsive, you can boot the device from a USB drive.


**To do a full wipe (factory reset) of a device**:

1.  On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.

2.  Choose the name of the device you want to wipe.

3.  On the blade showing the device's name, choose **Factory reset**, and then choose **Yes** to confirm the wipe.

If the device is on and connected, it takes less than 15 minutes for a wipe command to propagate across all device types.

### To delete devices in the Azure Active Directory portal

1.  Browse to [http://aka.ms/accessaad](http://aka.ms/accessaad) or choose **Admin** &gt; **Azure AD** from [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com).

2.  Log in with your Org ID using the link on the left side of the page.

3.  Create an Azure Subscription if you don’t have one. This should not require a credit card or payment if you have a paid account (choose the **Register your free Azure Active Directory** subscription link).

4.  Select **Active Directory** and then select your organization.

5.  Select the **Users** tab.

6.  Select the user whose devices you want to delete.

7.  Choose **Devices**.

8.  Remove devices as appropriate, such as those that are no longer in use, or those that have inaccurate definitions.


## Selective wipe

**Selective wipe** removes company data, including mobile app management (MAM) data (where applicable), settings, and email profiles from a device. Selective wipe leaves the user's personal data on the device. The device is removed from Intune. The following tables describe what data is removed, and the effect on data that remains on the device after a selective wipe. (The tables are organized by platform.)
