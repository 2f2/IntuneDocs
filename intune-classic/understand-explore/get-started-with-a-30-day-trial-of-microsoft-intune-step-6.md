## Alerts, notifications and reports
In the Intune administration console, **alerts** are used to quickly assess the overall health of managed devices in your organization. You can configure and customize alerts so that they report and display only the information you need for your organization. You can set whether an alert is enabled or disabled, configure the severity, use the display threshold to determine how frequently an alert event must be triggered before an alert is displayed, and also configure settings that are specific to certain types of alerts.

**Notifications** are emails used to inform administrators (and other users)  when certain types of alerts are triggered.

**Reports** are used to answer a range of questions, such as how many PCs have a particular application or update installed, what malware was blocked, or which users needed Remote Assistance over the last month.

To learn more about alerts, notifications, and reports, see [Monitoring and reports with Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/Deploy-Use/monitoring-and-reports-with-microsoft-intune).

## Intune capabilities
Intune has a wide variety of capabilities beyond those shown in these short setup steps. A few examples of these capabilities include:

-   **Control access to Exchange and Office 365.** For details, see [Manage app access to Exchange Online](/intune-classic/deploy-use/restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune).

-   **Management of corporate-owned iOS devices.** For details, see [Enroll corporate-owned iOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/Deploy-Use/enroll-corporate-owned-ios-devices-in-microsoft-intune).

-   **Mobile application management.** Managed mobile apps work with mobile application management policies to restrict certain app operations, such as copy and paste and screenshot functionality. For details, see [Create and deploy mobile application management policies with Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/Deploy-Use/manage-internet-access-using-managed-browser-policies).

-   **Control access to company resources.** You can deploy certificates, e-mail profiles, VPN profiles and Wi-Fi profiles to mobile devices, making it easier to quickly set up mobile devices. For details, see [Enable access to company resources with Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/Deploy-Use/enable-access-to-company-resources-with-microsoft-intune).
