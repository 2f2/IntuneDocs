# What is device management? 

Users have many devices, they open different files, visit different websites, install apps and games, share devices with family members, and more. These users also want access to work data, such as email. A key task of any Administrator is to protect and secure an organization's resources and data. This task is device management. And many organizations ask - **How can we protect our resources?**

This is where Microsoft Intune comes in. Microsoft Intune offers mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). Some key tasks of any MDM or MAM solution are to:

- Support a diverse mobile environment, including managing iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices securely
- Make sure devices and apps are compliant with your organization's security requirements
- Create policies that help keep your organization data safe on company-owned devices and personal devices
- Use a single, unified mobile solution to enforce these policies, and help manage devices, apps, users, groups, and more

Microsoft Intune is included with Microsoft 365 Enterprise, and integrates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD helps control who has access, and what they have access to.
