# How Microsoft Intune helps you comply with security and privacy requirements
When you manage devices owned by your company or that your users bring to work, one of your first concerns is your ability to keep those devices and their data secure. You also want to respect the privacy of your users who want the flexibility of bringing their devices to work, but not at the cost of losing control of their own data. Intune has safeguards in place to help you provide that kind of environment for your company and your employees.

In this topic you'll learn about Microsoft's documentation of Intune's security, privacy, and compliance credentials. You'll also read examples of how companies worldwide use Intune to create a secure and private data environment.

## Intune compliance stories
Customers worldwide have used Intune to ensure compliance with corporate requirements or government regulations. Here are some examples.

### Croatia
This Zagreb company wanted to provide access to corporate email to its 350 users only on managed smart phones, and to protect that email content, and was able to do that with Intune. They also enabled a PIN policy,  policies that restricted the of reading emails to compliant devices. In this way the company protects email content on mobile devices and those devices are compliant with corporate policy.

The IT department of this Zagreb company was asked to enable a secure VPN connection from 300 smart phones to the main datacenter. Mobile workers also required updated application data on their mobile devices. This was accomplished using Intune together with a secured VPN client deployment (Cisco AnyConnect), with application deployment and application data refresh enabled only for managed devices.
