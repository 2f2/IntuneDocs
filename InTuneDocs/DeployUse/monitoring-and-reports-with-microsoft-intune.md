# Monitoring and reports with Microsoft Intune
Intune offers IT admins two ways to monitor an organization's devices, including software license status and actions that affect devices (such as wiping a device).

-   **[Reports](../DeployUse/understand-microsoft-intune-operations-by-using-reports.md)** help you monitor the status of devices that are managed by Intune. This includes software update status, the software that is installed, and certificate compliance.
    Â In Intune reports, you also can examine the hardware and software inventory collected by devices and computers.

-   **[Alerts](../DeployUse/get-notified-by-alerts.md)** help you monitor the health of devices that are managed by Intune. This includes Endpoint Protection status and warnings, to alert you to malware, and warnings that are related to limited disk space or network connectivity.

Devices and computers that are managed by Intune return detailed information about their properties and installed software. Intune gives you the tools and reports to examine and present the information. For details, see [Understand your devices with inventory in Microsoft Intune](../DeployUse/understand-your-devices-with-inventory-in-microsoft-intune.md).
