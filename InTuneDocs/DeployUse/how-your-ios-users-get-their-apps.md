# How your iOS users get their apps

Use this information to understand how and where your end users get the apps that you distribute through Microsoft Intune. 

**Required apps** - Apps that are required by the administrator and that are installed on the device with minimal user involvement, depending on the platform.

**Required apps** - Apps that are provided in the Company Portal app list and that a user may optionally choose to install.

**Managed apps** - Apps that can be managed through policies and that have been "wrapped" by Intune or have been built with the Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM) Software Development Kit (SDK). These apps can be managed by Intune, and application policies can be applied to them.

**Unmanaged apps** - Apps that can be managed through policies and that have not been wrapped by Intune or that do not incorporate the Intune MAM SDK. Application policies cannot be applied to these apps.
