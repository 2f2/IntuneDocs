# Overview of device and app lifecycles

Although the needs of individual organization might differ, there are certain common steps that all organizations will need to take on an ongoing basis, whatever their other operational needs. These can be grouped into two main categories, termed as **lifecycles**. The deployment lifecycle you follow will depend on the scenario youâ€™re trying to enable.  You might only need the device lifecycle, or the app lifecycle, and many need both of them.

For management purposes, all devices have a lifecycle, from initially enrolling the device, through to retiring it when it is no longer required. The [device management lifecycle](overview-of-device-lifecycle-in-microsoft-intune.md) walks you through all of the enrollment options, ways you can configure and protect these device, and then how to remove the devices from management.

Similarly, apps you work with have their own [app lifecycle](overview-of-device-lifecycle-in-microsoft-intune.md) that includes steps ranging from adding an app to Intune, all the way through to removing them when they are no longer required.
