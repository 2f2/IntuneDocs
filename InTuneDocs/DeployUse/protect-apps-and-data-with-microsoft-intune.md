# Protect apps and data with Microsoft Intune


Intune protects company data through multiple technology layers. At the identity layer, conditional access protects access to services by only allowing access from managed and compliant devices. At the client application layer, mobile application management (MAM) protects data loss by preventing data from moving to non-protected apps or storage locationsâ€”and by wiping data when a device is lost or stolen. We recommend using these two layers of protection together to help secure data while keeping your mobile workforce productive.

An important first step to protecting company data is to implement conditional access by making sure that devices used to access that data are using security protections like strong passwords and encryption, and are not jailbroken. Intune lets you set conditions that the devices have to comply with before they're allowed to access your company email and data.

[Conditional access](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) is determined by two types of policies you can set in Intune:
- [Compliance policies](introduction-to-device-compliance-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md) determine the compliance of a device. They evaluate settings and conditions like:
  - PINs and passwords: You can create rules to require passwords before unlocking a device, for the complexity requirements of the password, and other password settings.
  - Encryption: You can restrict access to devices that are encrypted.
  - When a device is not jailbroken or rooted: Intune can detect if an enrolled device is jailbroken. You can set the policy to block access on such devices.
- [Conditional access policies](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) are configured for a particular service like Exchange Online or SharePoint Online. For each service, you can define which groups of users these policies should apply to. For example, you can make sure that everyone in the finance department can only access company email from enrolled and compliant devices.

Securing access to company resources is just the first step to protecting company data. You still need the ability to protect the data after it's been accessed on the device. The data can now be copied, moved, saved to a different location, or shared. Intune solves this problem by providing you with the ability to restrict data movement by creating a set of rules like:
- Blocking copy and paste, or preventing data transfer outside of the work context.
- Preventing backup to personal cloud storage and preventing "Save as".
- Securing app access by requiring a PIN/passcode or corporate credentials.
- Having all web links open within the Intune Managed Browser.

These set of rules are referred to as [mobile app management (MAM) policies](protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md). You can apply MAM policies to apps that are running on devices that might or might not be managed by you.  

You can protect your company data by using MAM policies for devices that are **enrolled in Intune**, devices that are **enrolled and managed by another third-party mobile device management (MDM) solution**, or devices that are **not enrolled in any MDM solution**, like the employee-owned devices.

To associate an app with a MAM policy, the app must incorporate the Microsoft Intune App Software Development Kit (SDK), or use the App Wrapping Tool.

Apps like Microsoft Office apps have the Intune App SDK built in. You can see the full list of supported apps in the [Microsoft Intune mobile application gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-apps) on the Microsoft Intune application partners page. Choose the app to see the supported scenarios and platforms, and whether the app supports multi-identity.

You can also [enable your custom-built line-of-business apps](decide-how-to-prepare-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-microsoft-intune.md) to use with MAM policies.

In addition to restricting data movement, if a device gets lost or stolen or if the user is no longer working with your company, you can [selectively wipe company data](wipe-managed-company-app-data-with-microsoft-intune.md), leaving only personal data behind.
