# Set up Android device management
As an Intune administrator, you can enable management of Android devices, including Samsung Knox Standard devices, from the Company Portal. Users can then enroll their devices using the Company Portal app that is available from Google Play.

1.  **Set up Intune**<br>
    If you havenâ€™t already, prepare for mobile device management by  [setting the mobile device management authority](prerequisites-for-enrollment.md#set-mobile-device-management-authority) as **Microsoft Intune** and setting up MDM.

2.  **Android enrollment enabled**<br>
    No additional configurations in the Intune console are needed to enable Android mobile device enrollment.

3.  **Tell your users how to enroll their devices to get access to company resources.**

	For end-user enrollment instructions, see [Enroll your Android device in Intune](../enduser/enroll-your-device-in-intune-android.md). The enrollment process tells users what they can expect, and what IT administrators can and can't see on their devices.

	For information about other end-user tasks, see these articles:
