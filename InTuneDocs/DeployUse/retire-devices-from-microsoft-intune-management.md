# Retire devices from Intune management

Whether devices are corporate-owned or personally owned, eventually a managed device needs to be removed from Intune management. You might need to retire a device for a variety of reasons:

-	User leaves a company in a planned way (“managed” departure)
-	User leaves abruptly (gets fired, quits, etc.).
-	Loss of device
-	Repurpose of a device (move to another user, reuse for a different purpose, etc.)

You can do either a selective wipe or a full wipe on a device that's managed as a mobile device, or you can lock a device and reset its password. By wiping the device, you free up the user's subscription to add a different device. You can also retire PCs that are managed with the Intune client software.

## Wipe data and apps from devices
Both a selective wipe and a full wipe remove the device from Intune management by removing its policy and the company portal. As a result, the device no longer has the necessary credentials to sign in to company resources like Microsoft SharePoint, email, or Office 365.

[Selective wipe](use-remote-wipe-to-help-protect-data-using-microsoft-intune.md#selective-wipe) is the preferred action for employees who have enrolled their own devices in Intune because it does not affect personal information on the device. Only corporate data is removed.

For devices that need to be repurposed, you can also use a [full wipe](use-remote-wipe-to-help-protect-data-using-microsoft-intune.md#full-wipe), which resets the device to factory default settings.

## To delete devices in the Azure Active Directory portal

1.  Sign in with your organization credentials to [http://aka.ms/accessaad](http://aka.ms/accessaad) or [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com), and then choose **Admin centers** &gt; **Azure AD**.

2.  Create an Azure subscription if you don’t have one. This should not require a credit card or payment if you have a paid account. Choose the **Register your free Azure Active Directory** subscription link.

4.  Choose **Active Directory**, and then choose your organization.

5.  Choose the **Users** tab.

6.  Choose the user whose devices you want to delete.

7.  Choose **Devices**.

8.  Choose the devices as appropriate, and then choose **Delete device**. The device will be deleted the next time it syncs with Active Directory. This typically happens within four hours. After syncing, the device is removed from management. This removes one device from the device limit for this user.

## Retire managed computers
Computers that Intune client software manages can be removed from management in the Intune admin console. This also uninstalls the client software and deletes the Intune policy from the computer. See information about [retiring computers managed with the Intune client software](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client#retire-a-computer.md).

## Block access a device
If a device is lost or when you must retire a device because an employee left your company without returning a company-owned hardware, you can also [passcode reset and remotely lock](use-remote-lock-and-passcode-reset-in-microsoft-intune.md) the device. This keeps company information from being misused, although you might have to write the device off as a loss.

You also want to revoke the license from the employee's Intune user account. This frees up the license, and you can assign it to a new user account.

## Retire hardware
Sometimes, it’s the device itself that has reached its end of life. In such cases, [resetting it to factory settings](use-remote-wipe-to-help-protect-data-using-microsoft-intune.md) with a full wipe removes all data and removes the device from Intune. Then, you can get rid of the hardware according to your company’s policy.
