# Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies
Microsoft Intune **policies** are groups of settings that control features on mobile devices and computers. You create policies using templates that contain recommended or customized settings, and then deploy them to device or user groups.

## What types of policy can you use?

Intune policies fall into the following categories. The category you use affects how you create and deploy the policy.


- **Configuration policies:** These are commonly used to manage security settings and features on your devices. Use the information in this topic to learn about how to create and deploy these policies and to explore the available settings.
- **Device compliance policies:** These define the rules and settings that a device must comply with in order to be considered compliant by conditional access polices. You can also use compliance policies to monitor and remediate  the compliance of devices independently of conditional access.
For details, see [Device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune](introduction-to-device-compliance-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md).
- **Conditional access polices:** These policies help you secure email and other services depending on conditions you specify.
For details, see [Restrict access to email and O365 services with Microsoft Intune](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md).
- **Corporate device enrollment policies:** For information about corporate device enrollment policies, see [Set up iOS and Mac management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md).
- **Resource access policies:** This group of policies work together to help your users gain access to the files and resources they need to do their work successfully, wherever they are.
For details, see [Enable access to company resources with Microsoft Intune](enable-access-to-company-resources-with-microsoft-intune.md).


For a complete list of Intune policies, see [Microsoft Intune policy reference](microsoft-intune-policy-reference.md).




## Create a configuration policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Policy** &gt; **Configuration Policies** &gt; **Add**.

2.  Choose the policy you want, choose to use the recommended settings for the policy (when available; you can change these settings later), or to create a custom policy with your own settings.

	> [!TIP]
	> For help choosing the right policy, see [Microsoft Intune policy reference](microsoft-intune-policy-reference.md).

3.  When you are ready, choose **Create Policy**.

4.  On the **Create Policy** screen, configure a name and optional description for the policy.

5.  Configure the required policy settings, then choose **Save Policy**.

	If you need help with any policy settings, choose your policy type from the following list:

	- [Settings for iOS devices](ios-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Android devices](android-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 devices](windows-configuration-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Windows Phone 8.1 devices](windows-phone-8-1-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Windows 10 desktop and mobile devices](windows-10-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Windows Team devices](windows-team-configuration-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Windows edition upgrade](edition-upgrade-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Mac OS X devices](mac-os-x-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for Exchange ActiveSync](exchange-activesync-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [Settings for the terms and conditions policy](terms-and-condition-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)
	- [General settings for mobile devices (legacy)](mobile-device-security-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)

4.  In the confirmation dialog box, choose **Yes** to deploy the policy now, or choose **No** to create the policy without deploying it.

You can view and edit the new policy by browsing the sections for each policy type in **Policy** workspace.

When you create a policy that uses the recommended settings, the name of the new policy is a combination of the template name, date, and time. When you edit the policy, the name updates with the time and date of the edit.

Now that you have created a policy, you will typically want to deploy it to one or more groups of users or devices.

> [!TIP]
> You don't deploy all policy types. For example, the mobile application management policy is not deployed. This policy type is instead associated with an app, which you then deploy.

## Deploy a configuration policy

1.  In the **Policy** workspace, select the policy you want to deploy, then choose **Manage Deployment**.

2.  In the **Manage Deployment** dialog box:

    -   **To deploy the policy** - Select one or more groups to which you want to deploy the policy, then choose **Add** &gt; **OK**.

    -   **To close the dialog box without deploying it** - Choose **Cancel**.

When you select a deployed policy, you can view further information about the deployment in the lower part of the policies list.

## Manage policies

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Policy**, then browse to and select the policy you want to manage.

2.  Select one of the following actions:

- **Edit** - Opens the properties for the selected policy to allow you to make changes.
- **Delete** - Deletes the selected policy.<br>When you delete a policy, it is removed from all groups to which it was deployed.
- **Manage Deployment** - Select the group you want to deploy the policy to and choose **Add**.


## Frequently asked questions about Intune policies

### How long does it take for mobile devices to get policy or apps after they have been deployed?
When a policy or app is deployed, Intune immediately begins attempting to notify the device that it should check-in with the Intune service. This typically takes less than 5 minutes.

If a device doesn't check in to get policy after the first notification is sent, 3 more attempts are made.  If the device is offline (for example, it is turned off, or not connected to a network) then it might not receive the notifications.

In this case, the device will get policy on its next scheduled check-in with the Intune service as follows:

- iOS - Every 6 hours
- Android - Every 8 hours
- Windows Phone - Every 8 hours
- Enrolled Windows RT devices - Every 24 hours
- Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 PCs enrolled as devices - Every 8 hours

If the device has just enrolled the check-in frequency will be more frequent as follows:

- iOS - Every 15 minutes for 6 hours and then every 6 hours
- Android - Every 3 minutes for 15 minutes then every 15 minutes for 2 hours, and then every 8 hours
- Windows Phone - Every 5 minutes for 15 minutes then every 15 minutes for 2 hours, and then every 8 hours
- Windows PCs enrolled as devices - Every 3 minutes for 30 minutes, and then every 8 hours

Users can also launch the Company Portal app and sync the device to immediately check for policy anytime.

### What actions cause Intune to immediately send notification  to a device?
Devices check in with Intune either when they receive a notification telling them to check-in, or during their regularly scheduled check-in as shown in the tables above.  When you target a device or user specifically with an action such as a wipe, lock, passcode reset, app deployment, profile deployment (Wi-Fi, VPN, e-mail, etc.), or policy deployment, Intune will immediately begin trying to notify the device that it should check-in with the Intune service to receive these updates.

Other changes such as revising the contact information in the company portal do not cause an immediate notification to devices.

> [!TIP]
> When a policy containing settings is deployed to an Android device, the user is prompted that they need to take action to comply with the policy. Until the users take this action, or the device is restarted, the new policy settings will not take effect.

### If multiple policies are deployed to the same user or device how do I know which settings will get applied?
Itâ€™s important to know that when two or more policies are deployed to the same user or device the evaluation for which setting is applied is done at the individual setting level.

-   Compliance policy settings always have precedence over configuration policy settings

-   The most restrictive compliance policy setting is applied if evaluated against the same setting in a different compliance policy

-   If a configuration policy setting conflicts with a setting in a different configuration policy, this conflict will be displayed in the Intune console. You must manually resolve such conflicts.

### What happens when mobile application management (MAM) policies conflict with each other? Which one will be applied to the app?
Conflict values are the most restrictive settings available in a mobile application management policy, except for the number entry fields (like PIN attempts before reset).  The number entry fields will be set to the same as the values as if you create a MAM policy in the console using the recommended settings option.

Conflicts occur when two policy settings are the same.  For example, you configured two MAM policies that are identical except for the copy/paste setting.  In this scenario, the copy/paste setting will be set to the most restrictive value, but the rest of the settings will be applied as configured.

If one policy is deployed to the app and takes effect, and then a second one is deployed, the first one deployed will take precedence and stay applied, while the second shows in conflict. However, if they are both applied at the same time, meaning that there is no preceding policy, then they will both be in conflict, and any conflicting settings will be set to the most restrictive values.

### What happens when iOS custom policies conflict?
Intune does not evaluate the payload of Apple Configuration files or custom OMA-URI policy, it merely serves as the delivery mechanism.

Therefore, when you deploy a custom policy, ensure the settings configured do not conflict with compliance, configuration or other custom policies. In the case of a custom policy with settings conflicts, the order in which are settings are applied is random.

### What happens when a policy is deleted, or no longer applicable?
When you delete a policy, or remove a device from a group to which a policy was deployed, the policy and settings will be removed from the device according to the following tables:

#### Enrolled devices

- Wi-Fi, VPN, certificate and email profiles - These profiles are removed from all supported enrolled devices.
- All other policy types
	- **Windows and Android devices** - Settings are not removed from the device.
	- **Windows Phone 8.1 devices** - The following settings are removed:
		- Require a password to unlock mobile devices
		- Allow simple passwords
		- Minimum password length
		- Required password type
		- Password expiration (days)
		- Remember password history
		- Number of repeated sign-in failures to allow before the device is wiped
		- Minutes of inactivity before password is required
		- Required password type â€“ minimum number of character sets
		- Allow camera
		- Require encryption on mobile device
		- Allow removable storage
		- Allow web browser
		- Allow application store
		- Allow screen capture
		- Allow geolocation
		- Allow Microsoft Account

		- Allow automatic connection to free Wi-Fi hotspots
		- Allow Wi-Fi hotspot reporting
		- Allow factory reset
		- Allow Bluetooth
		- Allow NFC
		- Allow Wi-Fi
	
	- **iOS** - All settings are removed, except:
		- Allow voice roaming
		- Allow data roaming
		- Allow automatic synchronization while roaming

#### Windows PCs running the Intune client software

- **Endpoint Protection settings** - Settings are restored to their recommended values. The only exception is the setting **Join Microsoft Active Protection Service** for which the default value is **No**. For details, see [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md).
- **Software updates settings** - Settings are reset to the default state for the operating system. For details, see [Keep Windows PCs up to date with software updates in Microsoft Intune](keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune.md).
- **Microsoft Intune Center settings** - Any support contact information that was configured by the policy is deleted from computers.
- **Windows Firewall settings** - Settings are reset to the default for the computer operating system. For details, see [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md).


### How can I refresh the policies on a device to ensure they are current (applies to Windows PCs running the Intune client software only)

1.  In any device group, select the devices on which you want to refresh the policies, and then choose **Remote Tasks** &gt; **Refresh Policies**.
2.  Choose **Remote Tasks** in the bottom-right corner of the Intune administration console to check the task status.
