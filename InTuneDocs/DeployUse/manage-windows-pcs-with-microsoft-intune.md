# Manage Windows PCs with Intune PC client software
Instead of [enrolling Windows PCs as mobile devices](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), you can manage Windows PCs by installing the Intune client software. 

Intune manages Windows PCs using policies similar to the way Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do. If you will be managing Active Directory domain-joined computers with Intune, you should [be sure that Intune policies do not conflict with any GPOs](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md) that are in place for your organization.

While the Intune client supports [policies that help protect PCs](policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) by managing software updates, Windows firewall, and Endpoint Protection, PCs managed with the Intune client cannot be targeted with other Intune policies.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices that run Windows 8.1 can be managed using the Intune client or they can be enrolled as mobile devices. The information below applies to computers that run the Intune client. Installing both the Intune PC client and enrolling the Windows device for mobile device management is not supported.

## Requirements for Intune PC client management

**Hardware**:
The following are minimum hardware requirements for installing the Intune client:

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Network|The client requires the PC to have Internet connectivity.|
|Processor and Memory|Refer to the processor and RAM requirements for the PC's operating system.|
|Disk space|200Â MB available disk space before the client software is installed.|

**Software**:
The following are software requirements for installing the client:

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Operating system | Windows device running Windows 7 or later. |
|Administrative permissions|The account that installs the client software must have local administrator permissions on that device.|
|Windows Installer 3.1|The PC must have, at a minimum, Windows Installer 3.1.<br /><br />To view the version of Windows Installer on a PC:<br /><br />-   On the PC, right-click **%windir%\System32\msiexec.exe**, and then click **Properties**.<br /><br />You can download the latest version of Windows Installer from [Windows Installer Redistributables](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234258) on the Microsoft Developer Network website.|
|Remove incompatible client software|Before you install the Intune client software, you must uninstall the any Configuration Manager or System Management Server client software from that PC.|

## Install the Intune computer client
The Intune client software can be installed in one of the following ways:

-   [Manually deploy the Microsoft Intune client software](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md#to-manually-deploy-the-client-software). In this type of deployment, an administrator downloads the  Intune client software and manually installs it on each PC.

  To download the  Intune client software, open the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com) and choose **Admin** > **Client Software Download**, and click **Download Client Software**.

-   You can use the same files you download to manually install the  Intune client to [deploy the client to domain-joined computers using Active Directory GPOs](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md#to-automatically-deploy-the-client-software-by-using-group-policy).

-   Finally, you can also deploy the  Intune client software to computers as part of an [operating system deployment](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md#install-the-microsoft-intune-client-software-as-part-of-an-image).

## Computer management with the Intune computer client
After the Intune client is installed, the client software enables several computer management capabilities including: [application management](deploy-apps-in-microsoft-intune.md), Endpoint Protection, hardware and software inventory, remote control (through remote assistance requests), software updates, and compliance settings reporting.

Several computer management tasks enabled by the computer client are managed using Intune policies such as:

-   Configuring the [Windows Firewall settings](help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md) on managed computers.

-   Configuring [software update settings](keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune.md) for managed computers to check for, and download, required software updates.

-   Helping to secure managed computers from potential threats and malicious software through [real-time monitoring and Endpoint Protection](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md) management.

In addition to the Intune client agent actions taken locally on individual computers, you can also use the Intune admin console to perform other [common computer management tasks](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md) on Windows PCs with the client installed to:

-   View hardware and software inventory information about managed computers

-   Remotely restart a computer

-   Retire a computer to uninstall the client software and remove it from management with Intune

-   Link users to specific managed computers

-   Respond to remote assistance requests

The Intune client agent usually runs quietly in the background without the need for much user interaction or troubleshooting. However, should you need help in resolving computer management issues, there are several [resources available to help you solve them](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-client-setup-in-microsoft-intune).
