# What to tell your end users about using Microsoft Intune

Use the following links and information to understand the steps that your end users take to do different tasks in Intune.

Be sure that you include IT administrator contact information when you [customize the Company Portal](/Intune/get-started/start-with-a-paid-subscription-to-microsoft-intune-step-7) so that your users can get help if they need it.


## How your end users find how-to and troubleshooting information

The Company Portal website and Company Portal app shows enrolled users a "Learn more" or "How to resolve this" link that points them to steps on how to fix the issue or complete the task.

For example, if Android users see a message in the Android Company Portal app that says users are missing a required certificate, they can tap a link to go to an article with steps on how to get the certificate.

Use the following links to see the steps that users are sent to from the Company Portal website or app. The links are divided into different sections, including Company Portal app installation and Intune enrollment, general tasks that users can do on their devices, and troubleshooting.

- [Using your Android device with Intune](/Intune/EndUser/using-your-android-device-with-intune)
- [Using your iOS or Mac OS X device with Intune](/Intune/EndUser/using-your-ios-or-mac-os-x-device-with-intune)
- [Using your Windows device with Intune](/Intune/EndUser/using-your-windows-device-with-intune)
- [Using the Intune Company Portal website](/Intune/EndUser/using-the-intune-company-portal-website)


## Enrollment guide that you can customize for your users

You can use this [customizable, end-user Intune enrollment template for IT administrators](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/End-user-Intune-enrollment-55dfd64a) to create your own enrollment instructions for your end users.
