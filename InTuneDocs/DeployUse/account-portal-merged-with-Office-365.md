# Intune Account Portal has merged with the Office 365 management portal

Last year we began moving Intune Account Portal functionality to the Office 365 management portal. This move is now complete and the Intune Account Portal has been retired.

Users and Groups are managed in appropriately named tabs whereas purchasing and subscription management is now under Billing.

Depending on how you purchased, you will access software downloads at either the Volume Licensing portal or the [Microsoft Online Services Customer Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=259567).

Be sure to update your bookmarks.

Read more about the move in our [Microsoft Intune blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/microsoftintune/2015/09/01/intune-and-ems-subscriptions-now-available-in-the-office-365-portal/) or go directly to the new [Office 365 management portal](https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx) at https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx with your existing credentials.
