# Configure and deploy Lookout for Work apps
In this release, only Android for Work app is supported.
## Android
This section discusses how to configure and deploy the Lookout for Work Android application for devices enrolled in Intune.  
Step 1:	In the Intune admin console go to Apps and choose Add Apps.   
Step 2:	Choose External Link.
Step 3:	Specify the URL:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout.enterprise
>[!NOTE]
>Do not click the box for requiring a managed browser.

Step 4:	On the next page fill in the following information:
  * **Publisher:** Lookout Mobile Security
  * **Name:**   Lookout for Work
  * **Description:**  Lookout offers the best protection against mobile threats to keep your device safe. When the Lookout app is installed on the device, the app protects your device from threats and will alert you, and your company administrator, if any are found.
  * **Category:** Computer Management
Step 5:  Upon successful completion you see a message **Upload of data to Microsoft Intune successfully completed**.

On the Intune Console when you click on the **Apps** you will now see the Lookout for Work app in the list

Step 6: At this point Intune knows how to deploy the L4W android app.   You can deploy the app to users, by selecting the Lookout for Work app shown in the screen above and selecting **Manage Deployment**.

Step 7: You must select the same group of users   that was used during the Lookout MTP Enrollment to deploy the  apps .
Step 8: Choose the **Required Install** option to require that the Lookout app be installed on the userâ€™s device.

### Device activation
With the **Required Install** option selected for deployment, Intune will push the Lookout for work application to the device.   
When the user opens the Lookout for Work on the device they will need to Activate, and choose the Sign in with Azure Active Directory option. A detailed walkthrough with the end-user flow can be found in [this]() topic.
