# Your paid Microsoft Intune or Enterprise Mobility subscription might include a license to use certain downloadable software

The following software might be included in your paid Microsoft Online Services subscription. Review your agreement terms to see your licensed software.

| **Microsoft Service**    | **On-premises software**           |
| ------------- |-------------|
|Enterprise Mobility Suite |	Advanced Threat Analytics |
|Enterprise Mobility Suite |	Microsoft Identity Manager |
|Microsoft Intune |	System Center Configuration Manager |
|Azure Active Directory Premium |	Microsoft Identity Manager |

The location to download the software depends on the method you used to buy your Microsoft Online Service.

If you bought via an account agreement or prepaid through a Microsoft Certified Partner, then email that you received after you activated your product includes a link to the [Volume License download portal](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

If you bought directly with a credit card or through a Cloud Solutions Provider, then you will download software from the [Microsoft Online Software Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/online/downloads/HomeRealmDiscovery.aspx).

If you are unsure of your licensed software, contact your account executive or partner, or reach out to [Microsoft Online Services support](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dn932057.aspx).

If you instead signed up for a trial, you can obtain trial versions by visiting the [TechNet Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/try).
