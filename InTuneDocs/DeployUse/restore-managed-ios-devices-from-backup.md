# Restore Intune managed iOS devices from backup

There will be cases when you or your users will need to restore an iOS device from a backup, such as when a user gets a new device. This topic explains additional steps that you might have to take to set up Intune management after restoring the device.

## Restoring backups onto the same device

If the backup is being restored onto the same device, then the enrollment state on that device will also be restored. There is no need for additional action.

## Restoring backups onto different devices

If the backup is being restored onto a different device, then the enrollment state is not automatically restored on the new device. Users need to follow standard enrollment steps in the Company Portal app on app version 2.1.22 or later to [enroll their iOS device into Intune](/Intune/EndUser/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios).

> [!NOTE]
> If youâ€™re targeting your end users with conditional access policies, they will not be able to access corporate email until after they re-enroll.

> [!TIP]
> An example communication for your users could be as follows:
To enroll on your new device, make sure that the Company Portal app is on version 2.1.22 or later. To check the version, open the Company Portal app, tap the Menu button in the upper right, and then tap About. If you are on an earlier version, exit the Company Portal app and open the App Store. Tap the Updates button in the bottom right corner, then tap the Update button next to the Company Portal item in the list. Once the update completes, launch the Company Portal app and [enroll your iOS device into Intune](/Intune/EndUser/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios).
