# Administrative accounts, websites, and permissions in Microsoft Intune

You use two types of administrator accounts, user accounts with additional permissions, and two separate administration consoles to grant your admins access to the things they should manage. The following sections explain these accounts and portals.

|Account type|Permission levels|More information|
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|**Tenant administrator**|Tenant administrators are assigned one administrator role, which defines the administrative scope for that user and the tasks they can manage.<br /><br />Administrator roles are common between the different Microsoft cloud services although some services might not support some roles. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] uses the following roles:<br /><br />**Global administrator**<br /><br />**Billing administrator**<br /><br />**Password administrator**<br /><br />**Service support administrator**<br /><br />**User management administrator**<br /><br />Learn more about administrator roles: [Reference for Tenant Administrator accounts for Microsoft Intune](reference-for-tenant-administrator-accounts-for-microsoft-intune.md).<br /><br />[Assign administrative users](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646983.aspx#BKMK_AssignAdmins).|By default, the account you use to create your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] subscription is a tenant administrator with the global administrator role.<br />                        **As a tenant administrator, you use the [!INCLUDE[wit_icp_1](./includes/wit_icp_1_md.md)] to manage your subscription for [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)].** and assign tenant administrators from within the [!INCLUDE[wit_icp_2](./includes/wit_icp_2_md.md)].<br /><br />Use a tenant administrator with the global administration role to access the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](./includes/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] to assign your first service administrator. As a best practice, do not use a tenant administrator for day-to-day management tasks. A tenant administrator does not require a license to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] to access the [!INCLUDE[wit_icp_2](./includes/wit_icp_2_md.md)].<br /><br />The tenant administrator is a common concept between Microsoft cloud services. When you subscribe to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)], your service is a [tenant of Microsoft AzureÂ AD](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj573650.aspx).|
|**Service administrator**|Service administrators are assigned one of the following permissions:<br /><br />**Full access**: Grants access to all areas of the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](/includes/wit_adminconsole_md.md)], with no restrictions. Can also add and manage other service administrators.<br /><br />**Read-only access**: Grants read permission to all areas of the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](/includes/wit_adminconsole_md.md)]. A read-only service admin cannot modify data, but can run reports.<br /><br />**Helpdesk - Groups Node**: Grants permissions that enable the service administrator to only perform a set of tasks commonly associated with helpdesk scenarios. For information about this permission set, see [Control what admins can see in the Microsoft Intune admin console](control-what-admins-can-see-in-the-microsoft-intune-admin-console.md).<br /><br />Assign administrative users|By default, [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] does not assign a service administrator. Instead, you must use a tenant administrator with the global administrator role to assign the first service administrator for your subscription. **As a service administrator, you use the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](/includes/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] to manage day-to-day tasks for [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/includes/wit_nextref_md.md)]**.<br /><br />You assign service administrators from within the administrator console. A service administrator requires a license to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](/includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] before the account can access the administration console.|
|**Device enrollment manager**|Device enrollment managers are standard user accounts that have additional permission to enroll more than five devices.<br /><br />[Learn about device enrollment managers](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn764961.aspx).|By default, each [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)] user can enroll up to five devices.<br /><br />However, you can give a user account the device enrollment manager permission and then use that account to enroll large groups of corporate-owned devices. This is useful when the devices might be assigned to users on a temporary basis, or serve in a kiosk mode where a user to device association is not required.|

 +Different administrative tasks require you to use one of two administrative websites. Because the configurations you make and data from devices that you manage are stored in the cloud, you can manage your subscription from any computer with [a supported browser](supported-web-browsers.md).
