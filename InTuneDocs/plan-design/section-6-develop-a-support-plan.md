# Develop an Intune support plan

[!INCLUDE[note for both-portals](../includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Having an Intune support plan can be beneficial in more effectively identifying and resolving Intune related issues and improving the end user’s overall Intune experience. Here are some questions to consider when developing your Intune support plan:

-   Which team(s) will be responsible for providing Intune support?

-   If your support organization has multiple tiers (e.g. tier 1-3), what are the Intune support responsibilities for each tier?

-   What process will be used to provide Intune support?

-   How you plan to provide Intune support training?

-   What are the opportunities to involve the support team early in the Intune deployment process?

Let’s review each area in more detail.

## Which teams are responsible for providing support?

Organizations may have different tiers/levels (1-3) of support. For example, tier 1 and 2 may be part of the support team, and tier 3 include members of the MDM team responsible for the deployment of Intune.

## What is the support process?

Tier 1 is normally the first level of support and typically the first tier to be contacted by the user for support requests. If tier 1 is unable to resolve the end user’s issue, they would escalate it to tier 2, and tier 2 would escalate it to tier 3 if needed. In addition, Microsoft support may be considered as tier 4.

For the initial production rollout phases, organizations could have all three tiers participating in a bridge or skype call. Here’s one example of how an organization could implement their IT support/helpdesk work-flows:

1.  End-user contacts IT support/helpdesk tier 1 with an enrollment issue.

2.  IT support/helpdesk tier 1 is unable to determine the root cause and escalates to tier 2.

3.  IT support/helpdesk tier 2 investigates, but is unable to resolve the issue and escalates to tier 3, providing additional information to assist with the investigation.

4.  IT support/helpdesk tier 3 investigates further, determines the root cause and communicates the resolution to tier 2 and 1.

5.  IT support/helpdesk tier 1 then contacts the customer and resolves their issue.

Using this type of approach, especially in early stages of the Intune rollout would add many benefits, such as:

-   Assisting in technology learning and ramp up.

-   Quickly identifying issues and resolution.

-   Improving the overall user experience.

## How you plan to provide Intune support training?

It’s important to provide Intune technical training for your IT support/helpdesk staff so that the training is at an appropriate level, and applies for the specific support tier and their responsibilities. Organizations could have the Intune MDM team conduct this training to the support leads (training the trainer), then have the leads provide this training to their support team members. This training can typically be provided in 2-3 hours, and it includes lecture and labs.

An example of an Intune support training agenda is provided below.

-   Troubleshooting Common Issues

-   Tools and Resources

-   Q&A

>[!TIP]
> [Additional resources](additional-resources.md) provides technical resources that may be valuable for your support team to review and leverage during their ramp up of Microsoft Intune.

## What opportunities are there to involve the support team earlier?

Involving the IT support/helpdesk staff in early stages of Intune deployment planning and pilot efforts can be very beneficial to organizations. It provides the support staff with opportunities for exposure to the solution and gaining valuable experience. This also helps prepare the IT support/helpdesk staff for supporting the organizations full production rollout.
