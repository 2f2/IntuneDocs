# Determine Intune deployment goals, objectives and challenges

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Having a good deployment plan begins with first identifying your organization’s deployment goals and objectives, along with potential challenges. Each organization is unique and will have their own deployment goals, objectives and challenges. Let’s discuss each area in more detail.

## Deployment Goals

Deployment goals are the long-term achievements intended by implementing Microsoft Intune in an organization. Listed below are some examples of an organization’s Intune deployment goals along with the description and business value for each.

-   **Integrate with Office 365 and support the use of Office mobile apps**

    -   **Description:** Provide tight integration with Office 365 and the use of Office mobile applications with application protection.

    -   **Business value:** Secure and improved user experience by allowing users to use apps they are familiar with and prefer.

-   **Enable access to internal corporate services on mobile devices**

    -   **Description:** It’s the strategic direction of the organization to enable employees to be productive wherever they need to work from, and with whichever device is most appropriate for them. This project should look to enable mobile productivity and access to corporate data in a safe manner.

    -   **Business value:** Enabling employees to be agile and work from where they need, allows the business to be more competitive and to provide a more rewarding working environment.

-   **Provide data protection on mobile devices**

    -   **Description:** Where data is stored on a mobile device, it should be protected from malicious and accidental loss or sharing.

    -   **Business value:** Data protection is vital to ensure that we remain competitive, and that we treat our clients and their data with the utmost diligence.

-   **Reduce costs**

    -   **Description:** When possible, the project reduces deployment and operating costs.

    -    **Business value:** The efficient use of resources enables the business to invest in other areas, compete more effectively, and provide better service to clients.

## Deployment Objectives

Deployment objectives are the actions an organization can take to reach its Microsoft Intune deployment goals. Below are listed some examples of an organization’s deployment objectives, and how each one would be accomplished.

-   **Reduce the number of device management solutions**
<br>
    -   **Execution:** Consolidate to a single mobile device management solution, Microsoft Intune for corporate data protection of apps and devices.
<br></br>
-   **Provide secure access to Exchange and SharePoint Online**
<br>
    -   **Execution:** Implement Microsoft Intune Conditional Access for Exchange and SharePoint Online.
<br></br>
-   **Prevent corporate data from being stored or forwarded to non-corporate services on the mobile device**
<br>
    -   **Execution:** Implement Microsoft Intune App Protection Policies for Microsoft Office and LOB apps.
<br></br>
-   **Provide capability to wipe corporate data from the device**
<br>
    -   **Execution:** Enroll and manage devices with Microsoft Intune, providing the capability to perform a remote wipe of corporate data and resources when appropriate.

## Deployment Challenges

Deployment challenges are issues that are top of mind for an organization and may have a negative impact on their deployment. Sometimes they may be related to past issues they had experienced with previous projects, and would like to avoid or new issues related to the current deployment effort. Listed below are some examples of an organization’s Microsoft Intune deployment challenges along with potential mitigations.

-   Support readiness and end user experience is not included in an initial project scope.  This results in poor end user adoption and challenges supporting the solution.
<br>
    -   **Mitigation:** Incorporate support training and validating the end user experience with success metrics in your deployment plan.
<br></br>
-   Lack of clearly defined goals and success metrics result in intangible results, as well as reactive mode once issues arise.
<br>
    -   **Mitigation:** Define your goals and success metrics early in your project scope, and use these data points to flesh out your other rollout phases. Make sure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely) and plan to measure against your goals at each phase and to ensure your rollout project stays on track.
<br></br>
-   Neglecting to create, validate and aggressively share a clear value proposition that resonates for your organization, often results in limited adoption and lack of return on investment (ROI).
<br>
    -   **Mitigation:** While you may be excited to jump into your project, ensure you have a clearly-defined your goals and objectives. Include these in all awareness and training activities to help ensure users understand why your organization selected Intune.
