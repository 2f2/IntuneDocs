## December 2016

### Public preview of the new Intune admin experience on Azure<!--736542-->
In early calendar year 2017, we will be migrating our full admin experience onto Azure, allowing for powerful and integrated management of core EMS workflows on a modern service platform that’s extensible using Graph APIs. In advance of the general availability of this portal for all Intune tenants, we're excited to announce that we will begin rolling out a preview of this new admin experience later this month to select tenants.

The admin experience in the Azure portal will use the already announced new grouping and targeting functionality; when your existing tenant is migrated to the new grouping experience you will also be migrated to preview the new admin experience on your tenant. In the meantime, find out more about what we have in store for Microsoft Intune in the Azure portal in our [new documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-azure/introduction/what-is-microsoft-intune).

If you have any questions about the timeline for your tenant’s migration, contact our migration team at [intunegrps@microsoft.com](mailto:intunegrps@microsoft.com).

__Telecom expense management integration in public preview of Azure portal__ <!--747605-->
We are now beginning to preview integration with third-party telecom expense management (TEM) services within the Azure portal. You can use Intune to enforce limits on domestic and roaming data usage. We are beginning these integrations with [Saaswedo](http://www.saaswedo.com). To enable this feature in your trial tenant, please [contact Microsoft support](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/troubleshoot/how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune).

### New Capabilities

__Multi-factor authentication across all platforms__ <!--747590-->
You can now enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on a selected group of users when they enroll an iOS, Android, Windows 8.1+, or Windows Phone 8.1+ device from the Azure Management Portal by configuring MFA on the Microsoft Intune Enrollment application in Azure Active Directory.

__Ability to restrict mobile device enrollment__ <!--747596-->
Intune is adding new enrollment restrictions that control which mobile device platforms are allowed to enroll. Intune separates mobile device platforms as iOS, macOS, Android, Windows and Windows Mobile.
* Restricting mobile device enrollment does not restrict PC client enrollment.
* For iOS only, there is one additional option to block the enrollment of personally owned devices.

Intune marks all new devices as personal unless the IT admin takes action to mark them as corporate owned, as explained in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/manage-corporate-owned-devices).

### Notices

__Multi-Factor Authentication on Enrollment moving to the Azure portal__ <!--VSO 750545-->
Previously, admins would go to either the Intune console or the Configuration Manager (earlier than release October 2016) console to set MFA for Intune enrollments. With this updated feature, you will now login to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) using your Intune credentials and configure MFA settings through Azure AD. Learn more about this [here](https://aka.ms/mfa_ad).

__Company Portal app for Android now available in China__ <!--VSO 658093-->
We are publishing the Company Portal app for Android for download in China. Due to the absence of Google Play Store in China, Android devices must obtain apps from Chinese app marketplaces. The Company Portal app for Android will be available for download on the following stores:
* [Baidu](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836946)
* [Huawei](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836948)
* [Tencent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836949)
* [Wandoujia](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836950)
* [Xiaomi](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836947)

The Company Portal app for Android uses Google Play Services to communicate with the Microsoft Intune service. Since Google Play Services are not yet available in China, performing any of the following tasks can take up to 8 hours to complete. 

|Intune Admin Console| Intune Company Portal app for Android |Intune Company Portal Website|   
|---|---|---|
|Full wipe| Remove a remote device| Remove device (local and remote)|
|Selective wipe| Reset device| Reset device|
|New or updated app deployments| Install available line-of-business apps| Device passcode reset|

### Deprecations

__Firefox to no longer support Silverlight__ <!--VSO TBA-->
Mozilla is removing support for Silverlight in version 52 of the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox), effective March 2017. As a result, you will no longer be able to log in to the existing Intune console using Firefox versions greater than 51. We recommend using Internet Explorer 10 or 11 to access the admin console, or a [version of Firefox prior to version 52](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/). Intune's transition to the Azure portal will allow it to support a number of [modern browsers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-preview-portal-supported-browsers-devices) without dependency on Silverlight.

__Removal of Exchange Online mobile inbox policies__ <!--770687-->
Beginning in December, admins will no longer be able to view or configure Exchange Online (EAS) mobile mailbox policies within the Intune console. This change will roll out to all Intune tenants over December and January. All existing policies will stay as configured; for configuring new policies, use the Exchange Management Shell. Find out more information [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123783%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx).

__Intune AV Player, Image Viewer, and PDF Viewer apps are no longer supported on Android__ <!--747553-->
From mid-December 2016 on, users will no longer be able to use the Intune AV Player, Image Viewer, and PDF Viewer apps. These apps have been replaced with the Azure Information Protection app. Find out more about the Azure Information Protection app [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/rms-client/mobile-app-faq).

## November 2016

### New capabilities

<!--### View App States for All Platforms in Real Time
App installation status is now shown in real-time in the console. When you previously deployed an app, you had to wait for a targeted device to report back before the app install status was displayed in the Intune console.

### Streamline iOS App Management for your End Users
Intune can now automatically take over management of the previously installed app and no end user action is required.

Previously, if the end user of an enrolled iOS device installed an app from the App Store before you deployed that same app with a deployment action of __Available__, then the end user had to:

1. Open the __Company Portal__.
2. Select the app.
3. Tap __Install__ to enable Intune to take over management of the app.-->

__New Microsoft Intune Company Portal available for Windows 10 devices__
Microsoft has released a new [Microsoft Intune Company Portal app for Windows 10 devices](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj3pz). This app, which leverages the new Windows 10 Universal format, will provide the user with an updated user experience within the app and identical experiences across all Windows 10 devices, PC and Mobile alike, while still enabling all the same functionality that they are using today.

The new app will also allow users to leverage additional platform features like single sign-on (SSO) and certificate-based authentication on Windows 10 devices. The app will be made available as an upgrade to the existing Windows 8.1 Company Portal and Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal installs from the Windows Store. For more details, go to [aka.ms/intunecp_universalapp](http://aka.ms/intunecp_universalapp).

<!--### Support for Windows Store for Business Apps Being Deployed as Available
You can now deploy apps you synchronized from the Windows Store for Business (WSfB) with a deployment action of __Available__ or __Required__. After syncing WSfB apps into Intune, administrators will be able to target those apps as available installs to groups of users. End users will see the deployed WSfB apps as available for install in the Universal Company Portal, where they can choose whether they would like to acquire the apps.

### Conditional Access for MAM with SharePoint Online

You can block apps that are not supported by Intune mobile app management (MAM) policies from accessing SharePoint online.  You can get started in Intune mobile app management via the Azure portal. Look for the  Conditional Access section in the “Settings” blade which now includes the option for SharePoint online.-->

> [!IMPORTANT]

> __An Update on Intune and Android for Work__

> While you can deploy Android for Work apps with an action of __Required__, you can only deploy apps as __Available__ if your Intune groups have been migrated to the new Azure AD groups experience.

__Intune App SDK for Cordova plugin now supports MAM without enrollment__
App developers can now use the Intune App SDK for Cordova plugin to enable MAM functionality without device enrollment in their Cordova-based apps for Android and iOS. The Intune App SDK for Cordova plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/cordova-plugin-ms-intune-mam).

__Intune App SDK Xamarin component now supports MAM without enrollment__
App developers can now use the Intune App SDK Xamarin component to enable MAM functionality without device enrollment in their Xamarin-based apps for Android and iOS. The Intune App SDK Xamarin component can be found [here](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-sdk-xamarin).

### Notices

__Symantec signing certificate no longer requires signed Windows Phone 8 Company Portal for upload__
Uploading the Symantec signing certificate will no longer require a signed Windows Phone 8 Company Portal app. The certificate can be uploaded independently.

###Deprecations

__Support for the Windows Phone 8 Company Portal__
Support for Windows Phone 8 Company Portal will now be deprecated. Support for the Windows Phone 8 and WinRT platforms was deprecated in October 2016. Support for the Windows 8 Company Portal was also deprecated in October 2016.

## October 2016

### Conditional access for mobile application management
You will be able to restrict access to Exchange Online so that access can come only from apps that support Intune mobile application management policies such as Outlook. [This new feature](/intune/deploy-use/allow-policy-managed-apps-access-to-o365) pairs up perfectly with Intune mobile app management (MAM) policies as you can block access to built-in mail clients or other apps that have not been configured with the Intune MAM policies. This ensures your users are accessing your organization’s data with apps that can be protected using Intune MAM. You can get started in Intune mobile app management via the Azure portal. Look for the new Conditional Access section in the “Settings” blade.

### Conditional access for Windows PCs
You can now create conditional access policies through the Intune admin console to block Windows PCs from accessing [Exchange Online](/intune/deploy-use/restrict-access-to-exchange-online-with-microsoft-intune) and [SharePoint Online](/intune/deploy-use/restrict-access-to-sharepoint-online-with-microsoft-intune). You can also create conditional access policies to block access to Office desktop and universal applications.

### Android for Work support

> [!IMPORTANT]

> While you can deploy Android for Work apps with an action of __Required__, you can only deploy apps as __Available__ if your Intune groups have been migrated to the new Azure AD groups experience.

Intune is now part of the Android for Work (AfW) program. We will begin rolling out support for AfW features starting this month and continuing over the next few months. Note that  available app deployment of AfW leverages the new grouping and targeting experience. Newly provisioned Intune Service accounts will be able to use this feature once AfW is available to them.

<!--Existing Intune customers can use this feature in production once their tenant has been migrated. Existing customers are welcome to create a trial Intune account to plan for and test this feature until their tenant has been migrated. Any questions on grouping and targeting timelines, please contact our [migration team](mailto:intunegrps@microsoft.com).-->

### Lookout integration to protect iOS devices
In October, Microsoft is integrating with Lookout’s mobile threat protection solution to protect iOS mobile devices by detecting malware, risky apps, and more, on devices. Lookout’s solution helps you determine the threat level, which is configurable. You can create a compliance policy rule in Intune to determine device compliance based on the risk assessment by Lookout. Using conditional access policies, you can allow or block access to company resources based on the device compliance status.

End users of noncompliant iOS devices will be prompted to enroll, and will be required to install the Lookout for Work app on their devices, activate the app, and remediate threats reported in the Lookout for Work application to gain access to company data. Learn how to [Configure and deploy Lookout for Work apps](/intune/deploy-use/configure-and-deploy-lookout-for-work-apps).

You can enable your apps to use Intune mobile application management (MAM) policies by using the Intune App Wrapping Tool. Support for Intune MAM policies without requiring device enrollment is now available.

### Manage printing from apps managed using MAM policies
You can now prevent printing company data from apps that have MAM policies. This setting is available on the [Azure portal](/Intune/deploy-use/create-and-deploy-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune) and is supported on both [iOS](/Intune/deploy-use/ios-mam-policy-settings) and [Android](/Intune/deploy-use/android-mam-policy-settings) devices.
<!--TFS 1014328-->

### Support for fingerprints on Android devices
Android mobile app management (MAM) policies now allow users to access an app with their fingerprint instead of typing out their PIN. See this and other [mobile app management policy settings for Android here](/Intune/deploy-use/android-mam-policy-settings).

### Notices

__Android Samsung KNOX compatibility with Intune__
Certain models of the Samsung Galaxy Ace phone cannot be managed by Intune as Samsung KNOX devices. When you enroll these devices with Intune, they will instead be managed as standard Android devices.

The model numbers affected are:

* SM-G313HU
* SM-G313HY
* SM-G313M
* SM-G313MY
* SM-G313U

You and your end users need take no further action. For more information, visit the [Samsung KNOX](https://www.samsungknox.com) website.

__Company Portal app for Windows 8 is deprecated; support for Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT platforms are being deprecated__
Starting in October 2016, Microsoft Intune will deprecate support for the Windows 8 Company Portal. Microsoft Intune will also deprecate support for the Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT platforms. As a consequence, you will not be able to enroll or update any Windows Phone 8 or Windows RT devices.

You can continue to manage Windows Phone 8, Windows RT  and Windows 8 devices that are already enrolled. Update Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 devices to Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1, and use the corresponding Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal apps to continue distributing apps to these devices without disruptions.

Starting in November 2016, we will deprecate support for the Windows Phone 8 Company Portal.

### Windows conditional access
You can now create conditional access policies through the Intune admin console to block Windows PCs from accessing Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. You can also create conditional access policies to block access to Office desktop and universal applications.

### iOS 10 support
Existing Intune MDM and MAM scenarios are compatible with iOS 10. For tips, refer to the [Intune Support Team Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2016/09/13/support-tip-intune-support-for-ios-10/).

### App Wrapping Tool supports MAM without device enrollment for Android and iOS
The Intune App Wrapping Tool is a command line tool used to enable Intune MAM on line-of-business (LOB) apps for iOS and Android. It is the simplest way to incorporate the Intune MAM SDK into your app, so that your app can enforce MAM policies deployed through Intune. Using MAM policies, you can:

1. Encrypt the app's data.
2. Require the information worker to enter a PIN when launching the app.
3. Allow the app to transfer data only to other managed apps.
4. Prevent the app from backing up data to Android, iTunes, and iCloud.
5. Only allow Cut, Copy, and Paste into and out of other managed apps.

The public preview of the updated Intune App Wrapping Tool now supports MAM without device enrollment on internal LOB apps on iOS and Android. This means your end-users are not required to enroll their devices with Intune to use MAM-enabled LOB apps.

Anyone can test the public preview software and read helpful documentation, located in msintuneappsdk's GitHub:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">http://www.github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapper-ios-preview

<p style="margin-left: 40px">http://www.github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapper-android-preview

Before you install and use Microsoft Intune App Wrapper for Android and iOS Pre-Release you must:

* Review the Microsoft License Terms for Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android and iOS Pre-Release
* Print and retain a copy of the license terms for your records. By downloading and using Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android Pre-Release you agree to such license terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.
<!---TFS 1235607--->

### Intune groups begin transitioning to Azure Active Directory in September
Some new Intune accounts will use Azure Active Directory security groups rather than Intune user groups. You will know that you’re working with security groups, as the Intune portal groups page will have a link directing you to the Azure management portal.

### Lookout integration to protect Android devices
Microsoft is integrating with Lookout’s mobile threat protection solution to protect Android mobile devices by detecting malware, risky apps, and more, on devices. Lookout’s solution helps you determine the threat level, which is configurable. You can create a compliance policy rule in Intune to determine device compliance based on the risk assessment by Lookout. Using conditional access policies, you can allow or block access to company resources based on the device compliance status.

End users of noncompliant devices will be prompted to enroll, and will be required to install the Lookout for Work application on Android devices, activate the app, and remediate threats reported in the Lookout for Work application to gain access. To learn more, see [Restrict access based on device, network, and application risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/restrict-access-based-on-device-network-app-risk).


### Company Portal updates

__Android__

<p style="margin-left: 40px">**Addition of "Notifications" to the Company Portal for Android**<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">A new Notifications icon has been added to the Company Portal for Android on the homepage. Tapping this icon accesses the Notifications page, which shows your end users all items that require attention in the Company Portal app, such as device noncompliance, enrollment update, and enrollment activation. The iOS Company Portal app already has this notifications experience. Having the new Notifications page means that user won’t see the Company Access Setup page every time they launch or resume the Company Portal as long as the device is already enrolled. If you create your own end-user guidance, you might want to update your documentation to reflect this change. Find updated screenshots [here](https://aka.ms/androidcpupdate).  

__iOS__
<p style="margin-left: 40px">**Changes in support for the iOS Company Portal app**<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">All users of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app for iOS are now required to use its latest version. New users are able to download only the latest version, and current users are required to update to it. The latest version requires iOS 8.0 or later, so devices running older iOS versions cannot use the Company Portal or enroll until they update their device to iOS 8.0 or later and then update the Company Portal app to the latest version. Enrolled devices running versions below iOS 8.0 will continue to be managed and listed in the Intune Admin Console.
<!---TFS 1283165--->

<p style="margin-left: 40px">**Improvements in how iOS end users get their apps**<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">The following changes have been made to the apps tiles in the Company Portal app for iOS to point users to different views in a single location, the Company Portal website, for all of their apps. Apple restrictions prohibit line-of-business and managed app store apps from being listed in the Company Portal app, and require users to visit different views to find all of their apps.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">The **Company Apps** tile previously pointed to a list of all apps in the ALL tab of the Company Portal website, and it will continue to work the same way. The tile name has changed to **All Apps**.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">The **Other Apps** tile previously pointed to a view, inside the Company Portal app, that lists all apps that Apple permits the Company Portal app to show. The tile name has changed to **Featured Apps**, and tapping the tile will take users to the FEATURED tab of the Company Portal website.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">The **Categories** tile previously pointed to a view, inside the Company Portal app, that lists categories of apps. The tile name has not changed, but it now points to the CATEGORIES tab of the Company Portal website. You can find updated screenshots [here](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Improvements-in-how-iOS-d1104186).
  <!---TFS 1317133--->

<p style="margin-left: 40px">**Prompt to install the iOS Managed Browser app if IT Pro sets that requirement for an app**<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">If you have configured a web clip to open only in the managed browser, and the managed browser is not installed on a device, the Company Portal app on the device will prompt the user to install the managed browser before the web clip can be installed.
  <!---TFS 1228570--->

__Windows__
<p style="margin-left: 40px">**Feedback button added to Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal app**<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">The Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal app enables end users to send feedback about the app by using a new "send feedback" button. To find the button, users tap the “three dots” menu at the bottom right of the Company Portal app screen and then tap **send feedback**. The collected, anonymized feedback will help Microsoft improve the Company Portal app experience for users.
<!---TFS 1317806--->

### Intune glossary</br>
We’ve added a new [glossary topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/understand-explore/intune-glossary) to the library to help you understand some of the terms used in the Intune product.

## August 2016
### App management
<!---@Barry, I created the buckets of App management, Device management, etc but am not tied to them. Just wanted to break up and organize the feature list. If you're going to take over the Company Portal section, please talk to Stacie about how she's been organizing it. --->

__Hidden and shown apps for iOS 9.3__
For devices running iOS 9.3 or later, you can use the hidden and shown apps list in the iOS general configuration policy to:
- Specify a list of apps that will be hidden from users. Users cannot view, or launch these apps.
- Specify a list of apps that users can view and launch. No other apps can be viewed or launched.

The apps you can specify include both apps you have deployed, and the built-in iOS apps like Messages and Notes. For details, see [iOS policy settings in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/ios-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune)
<!---TFS 1279009 checked--->
__Allowed and blocked apps policy for Samsung KNOX devices__
You can now configure a custom policy for Samsung KNOX devices that lets you create one of the following:
- A list of apps that are blocked from running on the device. Even if installed, an app defined in the blocked list cannot be activated on the device.
- A list of apps that users of the device are allowed to install from the Google Play store. No other apps can be installed from the store.

These settings can only be used by devices that run Samsung KNOX.
For details, see [Use custom policies to allow and block apps for Samsung KNOX devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/custom-policy-to-allow-and-block-samsung-knox-apps).

<!--- I started putting TFS numbers in the What's Coming topic and found it helpful when updating the What's New. Up to you if you want to continue. --->

__Intune Viewer apps__
With the release of the new RMS sharing app, we are removing the following Intune Viewer apps, beginning in August, 2016:
- Intune AV Viewer
- Intune PDF Viewer
- Intune Image Viewer for Android from Google Play

Instead of using the Intune Viewer apps, we recommend using the new [Rights Management app (RMS sharing) for Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/end-user-experience-for-mam-enabled-apps-with-microsoft-intune#viewing-media-files-with-the-rights-management-sharing-app), which allows you to deploy one app instead of three separate apps to securely view corporate files on Android devices. When the Intune viewer app is no longer supported, it will be removed from the Google Store and will not be available for future use.

### Device management
__Android 7.0 support__
Intune provides “day 0” support for the forthcoming Android 7.0 operating system for mobile devices.
<!---TFS 1262053--->
### Google removal of remote passcode reset capability on Android 7.0 devices
Google is removing the ability of IT administrators and end users to remotely reset the passcode of Android 7.0 devices. Previously, IT administrators could remotely reset a user’s passcode, and end users could reset their passcodes from the Company Portal website.



### Company Portal updates
__Company Portal website__
- **Feedback link from the Company Portal to Microsoft** <br/>
The Company Portal website enables end users to tap a new "Feedback" link, at the bottom of the page, to send feedback to Microsoft about their experience with the site. The collected, anonymized feedback will help Microsoft improve the Company Portal website experience for users.
<!--- TFS 1313657 checked--->

__iOS__
- **Minimum iOS Managed Browser version updated to 8.0**<br/>
The Microsoft Intune Managed Browser app for iOS has been updated to support devices running iOS 8.0 or later. While iOS 7.1 devices can still use the existing Managed Browser app, encourage your users to update to iOS 8.0 or later to access and take full advantage of new Managed Browser features.  
<!---TFS 1313253 checked--->

### What's coming
__Intune Groups transitioning to Azure Active Directory Groups beginning in September 2016__
Intune is creating a new group management experience that uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) security groups as user and device groups in Intune. These groups will be used for all group management, policy deployment, and profile deployment **when we introduce the new Azure-based Intune admin portal**.

This new experience will keep you from having to duplicate groups between services, **allow you access to some new Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP) group features**, and provide extensibility using PowerShell and Graph. This will also unify the group management experience across enterprise mobility management.

To enable the move to Security Groups, the experience in the **current admin console** will undergo some modifications. **These changes, and the use of AAD security groups, will be recorded in the Intune documentation**.

Customers who are new to Intune will see **some of the security group changes before current tenants do**.

In addition to changes in group management, **the following functionality will be deprecated**:
- Excluding members or groups while creating a new group
- **Ungrouped Users** and **Ungrouped Devices** groups
- **Manage Groups** in the Service Admin role
- Custom group-based alerts for Notification Rules
- Pivoting with groups in reports

__Addition of 'Notifications' to the Company Portal for Android__
We are releasing an update to the Company Portal for Android in September that will introduce a new **Notifications** icon on the homepage. Tapping this icon will access the **Notifications** page that will show your end user all the items that require attention in the Company Portal app such as device non-compliance, enrollment update, and enrollment activation. If you also use the iOS Company Portal app, you’ll already see the notifications experience. With the introduction of the **Notifications** page, you will not see the **Company Access Setup** page every time you launch or resume the Company Portal for Android as long as the device is already enrolled. We hear many of you have created end-user guidance and appreciate advanced notice when your guidance/screen shots may need updating. Please update your documentation to reflect the upcoming change in experience. Find updated screenshots here: https://aka.ms/androidcpupdate.  

### Service deprecation
<!---@Barry, we started listing service deprecations earlier this summer. --->
- **Changes in support for the iOS Company Portal app**<br/>
In September, all users of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app for iOS will be required to use its latest version. New users will only be able to download the latest version and current users will be required to update to it. The latest version requires iOS 8.0 or later, so devices running older iOS versions won’t be able to use the Company Portal or enroll until they update their device to iOS 8.0 or later and then update the Company Portal app to the latest version. Enrolled devices running versions below iOS 8.0 will continue to be managed and listed in the Intune Admin Console.  

- **Minimum iOS Managed Browser version updated to 8.0**<br/>
In August, Intune will release an updated Microsoft Intune Managed Browser app for iOS that will only support devices running iOS 8.0 or later. While iOS 7.1 devices will still be able to use the existing Managed Browser app, please encourage your users to update to iOS 8.0 or later to access and take full advantage of new Managed Browser features.  
<!---TFS 1313253--->

- **Company Portal apps for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 are being deprecated from September 2016** <br/>
Starting in September 2016, Microsoft Intune will end support for the Microsoft Intune Company Portal apps for Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 platforms. Update devices to Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 and use the corresponding Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal apps to continue distributing apps to these devices.
<!---TFS 1255391--->

<!--- - **Custom Group Targeting of Notification Rules Removal.**<br/>
Intune notification rules define who an email alert will be sent to from Intune. Currently, you can configure notification rules to send emails to all users of devices in an Intune device group that you created. From around June 1st 2016 moving forward, targeting user-created groups will no longer be supported.

	Today, to target a notification rule to a group you created from the Microsoft Intune administration console, you would take the following steps:

	In the **Admin** workspace, click **Notification Rules** > **Create New Rule**

	In step two of the Create Notification Rule Wizard, select the device groups which the rule will target. This step, “select device groups”, is being removed from the Intune Console.

	The preliminary timeline for this change is as follows:
	- In August, 2016, new tenants will not see step two of the Create Notification Rule Wizard. Exiting tenants are unaffected.
	- Around September, 2016, some existing tenants will not see the “select device groups” in the wizard.
	- Around November, 2016, we expect that all tenants will not see the “select device groups” in the wizard.

### App management

__Improve the app provisioning profile update experience__
Apple iOS line of business mobile apps are built with a provisioning profile included and code signed with a certificate. When the app runs on an iOS device, iOS confirms the integrity of the iOS app and enforces policies defined by the provisioning profile.

The enterprise signing certificate you use to sign apps typically lasts for 3 years. However, the provisioning profile expires after 1 year. With this update, Intune gives you the tools to proactively deploy a new provisioning profile policy to devices that have apps that are near expiry while the certificate is still valid. For more information, see [Use iOS mobile provisioning profile policies to keep your line of business apps up to date](/intune/deploy-use/ios-mobile-app-provisioning-profiles).

__Xamarin SDK for Intune apps is available__
The Intune App SDK Xamarin component allows you to enable the Intune mobile app management features in your mobile iOS and Android apps built with Xamarin. You can find the component in the [Xamarin store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/Microsoft.Intune.MAM) or on the [Microsoft Intune Github page](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk).

### Company Portal updates

__Company Portal website__
- **Improved end-user experience when enrolling Windows devices**<br/>
When you are using conditional access, the enrollment steps for Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Desktop, and Windows 10 Mobile have been clarified in the Company Portal website. Users will now see separate “Device enrollment” and “Workplace Join” steps, making it easier for them to see the status of their device and to complete the process if they experience a Workplace Join (WPJ) failure. The separate steps are also expected to simplify the troubleshooting process for IT administrators. Previously, when end users tried to enroll and all enrollment steps succeeded except for WPJ, the enrolled device would not appear on the list of devices for users to identify, causing confusion for users.

__Android__
- **Android Company Portal app**<br/>
If Android end users see an error message that says their device is missing a required certificate, they can tap a "How to resolve this" button to get [steps](/intune/enduser/your-device-is-missing-a-required-certificate-android#your-device-is-missing-a-certificate-required-by-your-it-administrator) for installing the missing certificate. If users complete the steps, but see an additional "missing certificate" error message, they are asked to contact their IT administrator and provide this [link](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-device-enrollment-in-intune#android-certificate-issues), which contains steps that IT administrators can use to fix the certificate issue.

- **Restrict side-loaded app installations to enrolled devices**<br/>
Android devices can no longer install applications through the Company Portal website unless the devices have been enrolled in Intune by using the Intune Company Portal app for Android.
<!---TFS 1299082--->

__iOS__
- **Changes to Device Enrollment Managers accounts in the iOS Company Portal app**<br/>
To improve performance and scale, Intune no longer displays all Device Enrollment Managers (DEM) devices in the **My Devices** pane of the iOS Company Portal app. Only the local device running the app is displayed, and only if it is enrolled via the Company Portal app.

The DEM user may perform actions on the local device, but remote management of other enrolled devices can only be performed from the Intune admin console. Additionally, Intune is deprecating use of DEM accounts with either the Apple Device Enrollment Program or the Apple Configurator tool. Both these enrollment methods already support user-less enrollment for shared iOS devices.

Only use DEM accounts when user-less enrollment for shared devices is unavailable. For more information, see [Enroll corporate-owned devices with the Device Enrollment Manager in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune).

### Change of names for Windows features
- [Microsoft Passport for Windows](/intune/deploy-use/control-microsoft-passport-settings-on-devices-with-microsoft-intune) is now known as **Windows Hello for Business**.
- [Enterprise data protection](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/keep-secure/create-edp-policy-using-intune) is now known as **Windows Information Protection**.
