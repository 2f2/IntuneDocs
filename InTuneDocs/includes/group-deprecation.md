> [!NOTE]
> Starting in August, device group management will move to Azure Active Directory. **After the transition to Azure Active Directory groups, group assignment will not appear in the Corporate Enrollment Profile options.** Because changes will be made over a series of months, you might not see the change in the console yet.

> The **Corporate Enrollment profile** is required to enroll iOS devices via Appleâ€™s Device Enrollment Program or the Apple Configurator tool.

>New dynamic device groups assignment can be defined in Azure Active Directory based on the Corporate Enrollment Profile name. This process ensures that devices pre-assigned to a device group will automatically enroll in the group with policy and apps deployed. Further details will be published soon.
