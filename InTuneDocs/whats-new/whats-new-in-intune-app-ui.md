## What's coming in Intune App UI

### April 2017

#### New icons for the Managed Browser and the Company Portal <!--918433, 918431-->

The Managed Browser is receiving updated icons for both the Android and iOS versions of the app. The new icon will contain the updated Intune badge to make it more consistent with other apps in Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S).

The Company Portal is also receiving updated icons for the Android, iOS, and Windows versions of the app to improve consistency with other apps in EM+S. These icons will be gradually released across platforms from April to late May.

#### Sign-in progress indicator in Android Company Portal <!--953374-->

An update to the Android Company Portal app shows a sign-in progress indicator when the user launches or resumes the app. The indicator progresses through new statuses, beginning with "Connecting...", then "Signing in...", then "Checking for security requirements..." before allowing the user to access the app.

## January 2017

### Modernizing the Company Portal website <!--753980, announced 1701-->
Beginning in February, the Company Portal website will support apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website will align with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," ![Small image of the hamburger menu that is now added at the top left corner of the Company Portal website](./media/CP_hamburger_menu.png) which will contain helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page will be rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps.

![On the left, an image of the current version of the Company Portal website with its previous version of Apps, My Devices, and Featured and Categories views.
