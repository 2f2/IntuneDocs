### New user experience for the Company Portal app for Android <!--621622, announced 1702-->
Beginning in March, the Company Portal app for Android will follow [material design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html) to create a more modern look and feel. This improved user experience includes:

* __Colors__: tab headers can be colored according to your custom color palette.

![On the left, an image of the Company Portal app for Android before the update. On the right, an image of the Company Portal app for Android after the update. Both images show the Devices tab as the selected tab from the three available tabs of Apps, Devices, and Contact IT.](./media/CP_Android_DevicesTab_BeforeAfter.png)

### Modernizing the Company Portal website <!--753980, announced 1701-->
Beginning in February, the Company Portal website will support apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website will align with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," ![Small image of the hamburger menu that is now added at the top left corner of the Company Portal website](./media/CP_hamburger_menu.png) which will contain helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page will be rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps.
