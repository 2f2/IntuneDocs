# Manage Windows PCs as computers via Intune PC client software agent

[Enrolling Windows PCs as mobile devices](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md) is the preferred method of enrolling Windows PCs into Intune and allows automatic enrollment and bulk enrollment, but as an IT administrator you can alternatively choose to enroll and manage Windows PCs by installing the Intune client software agent described in this topic. The Intune software client is not supported with enrollment as a mobile device.

Intune manages Windows PCs using policies, similar to the way that Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do. If you will be managing Active Directory domain-joined computers with Intune, [be sure that Intune policies do not conflict with any GPOs](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md) that are in place for your organization. You can read more about [GPOs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh147307.aspx).

## Policies and app deployments for the Intune software client

While the Intune client software supports [management capabilities that help protect PCs](policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) by managing software updates, Windows firewall, and Endpoint Protection, PCs managed with the Intune client software cannot be targeted with other Intune policies, including those **Windows** policy settings that are specific to mobile device management.

When you use the Intune client software to manage Windows PCs, you can use only the policies shown under the **Computer Management** section.

For detailed descriptions of the policies that you can set, see:

- [Use policies to help protect Windows PCs that run the Intune client software](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Keep Windows PCs up to date with software updates in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Help protect Windows PCs using Windows Firewall policies in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune)

In addition, when deploying apps, you can use only the Windows Installer (.exe, .msi).

  ![Select platform and location for PC client software files](../media/select-platform-of-software-files-for-pc-agent.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage Windows 8.1 or later devices either as PCs, by using the Intune client software, or as mobile devices by using the mobile device management (MDM) functionality. You cannot use both methods together, so carefully consider your decision before deciding to manage PCs by using the Intune client software. This topic applies only to managing devices as PCs by running the Intune client software.

## Computer management capabilities with the Intune client software
In most scenarios, you will enroll your devices with Microsoft Intune, which provides a greater set of capabilities. However, you can also manage PCs by using the Intune software client, which provides the following features:

-   **[Software update management](/intune/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)** - You can keep PCs up to date and decide when updates are applied.

-   **[Windows Firewall policy](/intune/deploy-use/help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune)** - This helps to ensure that no PC that's used in your company has an inactive or improperly-configured Windows Firewall.

-   **[Anti-malware protection](/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune)** - Intune includes Endpoint Protection, which helps protect your PCs from malware.

-   **[Remote assistance](/intune/deploy-use/common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client#request-and-provide-remote-assistance-to-windows-pcs-that-use-the-intune-client-software )** - Intune lets users contact IT support staff, who can then provide assistance by using a remote desktop feature that is included with Intune (requires TeamViewer software).

-   **[Software license management](/intune/deploy-use/manage-license-agreements-for-windows-pc-software-in-microsoft-intune)** - Track how many software licenses are available, and how many available licenses are being used.
-   **[App deployment](/intune/deploy-use/add-apps-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune)** - Deploy software to PCs that you manage. Some app management features are not available when you manage PCs with the software client.

<!-- - **Compliance settings reporting** -->

## Common tasks for Windows PCs
In the Intune admin console, certain sections, such as **Updates**, **Protection**, and **Licenses** appear only if you have enrolled devices using the Intune client software.

  ![Admin console items that appear only for PC client](../media/admin-console-settings-only-for-pc-agent.png)

You can also use the Intune admin console to perform other common computer management tasks on Windows PCs that have the client installed:

-   View hardware and software inventory information about managed computers
-   Remotely restart a computer
-   Retire a computer to uninstall the client software and remove it from management with Intune
-   Link users to specific managed computers
-   Respond to remote assistance requests

For more information about the above tasks, see [common computer management tasks](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md).

## Management limitations of the Intune client software

Some management options, which can be used to manage PCs as mobile devices, cannot not used for PCs that are managed with the Intune client software:

-   Full wipe (selective wipe is available)

-   Conditional access

## Help with troubleshooting

The Intune client software usually runs quietly in the background without the need for much user interaction or troubleshooting. If you need to resolve PC management issues, you can check the logs. The Intune client software and corresponding logs are installed under the %Program Files%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement directory.

You can also review [Troubleshoot client setup in Microsoft Intune](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-client-setup-in-microsoft-intune) to check for issues that might occur, and any resolutions or workarounds.
