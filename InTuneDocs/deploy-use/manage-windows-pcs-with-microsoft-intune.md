# Manage Windows PCs with Intune PC client software
Instead of [enrolling Windows PCs as mobile devices](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), you can enroll and manage Windows PCs by installing the Intune client software.

Intune manages Windows PCs using policies, similar to the way that Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do. If you will be managing Active Directory domain-joined computers with Intune, [be sure that Intune policies do not conflict with any GPOs](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md) that are in place for your organization. You can read more about [GPOs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh147307.aspx).

While the Intune software client supports [management capabilities that help protect PCs](policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) by managing software updates, Windows firewall, and Endpoint Protection, PCs managed with the Intune software client cannot be targeted with other Intune policies, including those **Windows** policy settings that are specific to mobile device management. 

When you use the Intune software client to manage Windows PCs, you can use only the policies shown under the **Computer Management** section.

For detailed descriptions of the policies that you can set, see:

- [Use policies to help protect Windows PCs that run the Intune client software](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Keep Windows PCs up to date with software updates in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Help protect Windows PCs using Windows Firewall policies in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune)
- [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune)

In addition, when deploying apps, you can use only the Windows Installer (.exe, .msi).

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage Windows 8.1 or later devices either as PCs, by using the Intune client, or as mobile devices by using the mobile device management (MDM) functionality. You cannot use both methods together, so carefully consider your decision before deciding to manage PCs by using the Intune software client. This topic applies only to managing devices as PCs by running the Intune software client.

## Requirements for Intune PC client management

**Hardware**:
The following are minimum hardware requirements for installing the Intune client:

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Network|The client requires the PC to have Internet connectivity.|
|Processor and Memory|Refer to the processor and RAM requirements for the PC's operating system.|
|Disk space|200Â MB available disk space before the client software is installed.|

**Software**:
The following are software requirements for installing the client:

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Operating system | Windows device running Windows Vista or later. </br></br>**Home edition versions are not supported.**|
|Administrative permissions|The account that installs the client software must have local administrator permissions on that device.|
|Windows Installer 3.1|The PC must have, at a minimum, Windows Installer 3.1.<br /><br />To view the version of Windows Installer on a PC:<br /><br />  On the PC, right-click **%windir%\System32\msiexec.exe**, and then click **Properties**.<br /><br />You can download the latest version of Windows Installer from [Windows Installer Redistributables](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234258) on the Microsoft Developer Network website.|
|Remove incompatible client software|Before you install the Intune client software, uninstall any Configuration Manager, Operations Manager, Operations Management Suite, and Service Manager client software from that PC.|

## Computer management capabilities with the Intune software client

After the Intune client software is installed, management capabilities include: 

- [Application management](deploy-apps-in-microsoft-intune.md)

- [Real-time monitoring and Endpoint Protection](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md)

 > [!NOTE]
 > Endpoint Protection is the same thing as Windows Defender. Endpoint Protection applies to Windows 7 and Windows 8. For Windows 10 and later, the product name has changed to Windows Defender.

- [Windows Firewall settings management](help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md), hardware and software inventory, remote control (through remote assistance requests)

- [Software update settings](keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune.md)

- Compliance settings reporting

In the Intune admin console, certain sections, such as "Updates," "Protection," and "Licenses" appear only if you have enrolled devices using the Intune software client.

  ![Admin console items that appear only for PC client](../media/admin-console-settings-only-for-pc-agent.png)

You can also use the Intune admin console to perform other [common computer management tasks](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md) on Windows PCs that have the client installed:

-   View hardware and software inventory information about managed computers

-   Remotely restart a computer

-   Retire a computer to uninstall the software client and remove it from management with Intune

-   Link users to specific managed computers

-   Respond to remote assistance requests

## Management limitations of the Intune software client

Some management options, which can be used to manage PCs as mobile devices, cannot not used for PCs that are managed with the Intune software client:

-   Full wipe (selective wipe is available)

-   Conditional access

## Help with troubleshooting

The Intune client agent usually runs quietly in the background without the need for much user interaction or troubleshooting. If you need to resolve PC management issues, you can check the logs. The Intune software client and corresponding logs are installed under the %Program Files%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement directory.

You can also review [Troubleshoot client setup in Microsoft Intune](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-client-setup-in-microsoft-intune) to check for issues that might occur, and any resolutions or workarounds.
