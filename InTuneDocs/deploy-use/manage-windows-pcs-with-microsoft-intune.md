# Manage Windows PCs as computers via Intune PC client software agent

[Enrolling Windows PCs as mobile devices](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md) is the preferred method of enrolling Windows PCs into Intune and allows automatic enrollment and bulk enrollment, but as an IT administrator you can alternatively choose to enroll and manage Windows PCs by installing the Intune client software agent described in this topic. The Intune software client is not supported with enrollment as a mobile device.

Intune manages Windows PCs using policies, similar to the way that Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do. If you will be managing Active Directory domain-joined computers with Intune, [be sure that Intune policies do not conflict with any GPOs](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md) that are in place for your organization. You can read more about [GPOs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh147307.aspx).

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage Windows 8.1 or later devices either as PCs, by using the Intune client software, or as mobile devices by using the mobile device management (MDM) functionality. You cannot use both methods together, so carefully consider your decision before deciding to manage PCs by using the Intune client software. This topic applies only to managing devices as PCs by running the Intune client software.

## Requirements for Intune PC client management

**Hardware**:
The following are minimum hardware requirements for installing the Intune client software:

|Requirement|More information|

|Network|The client requires the PC to have Internet connectivity.|
|Processor and Memory|Refer to the processor and RAM requirements for the PC's operating system.|
|Disk space|200Â MB available disk space before the client software is installed.|

**Software**:
The following are software requirements for installing the client software:

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Operating system | Windows device running Windows Vista or later. </br></br>**Home edition versions are not supported.**|
|Administrative permissions|The account that installs the client software must have local administrator permissions on that device.|
|Windows Installer 3.1|The PC must have, at a minimum, Windows Installer 3.1.<br /><br />To view the version of Windows Installer on a PC:<br /><br />  On the PC, right-click **%windir%\System32\msiexec.exe**, and then click **Properties**.<br /><br />You can download the latest version of Windows Installer from [Windows Installer Redistributables](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234258) on the Microsoft Developer Network website.|
|Remove incompatible client software|Before you install the Intune client software, uninstall any Configuration Manager, Operations Manager, Operations Management Suite, and Service Manager client software from that PC.|

## Deploying the Intune software client
As an Intune admin, you can make the Intune software client available to users in a variety of ways. For guidance, see [Install the Intune software client on Windows PCs](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).

## Computer management capabilities with the Intune client software
In most scenarios, you will enroll your devices with Microsoft Intune, which provides a greater set of capabilities. However, you can also manage PCs by using the Intune software client, which provides the following features:

-   **[Software update management](/intune/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)** - You can keep PCs up to date and decide when updates are applied.

-   **[Windows Firewall policy](/intune/deploy-use/help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune)** - This helps to ensure that no PC that's used in your company has an inactive or improperly-configured Windows Firewall.

-   **[Anti-malware protection](/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune)** - Intune includes Endpoint Protection, which helps protect your PCs from malware.

-   **[Remote assistance](/intune/deploy-use/common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client#request-and-provide-remote-assistance-to-windows-pcs-that-use-the-intune-client-software )** - Intune lets users contact IT support staff, who can then provide assistance by using a remote desktop feature that is included with Intune (requires TeamViewer software).

-   **[Software license management](/intune/deploy-use/manage-license-agreements-for-windows-pc-software-in-microsoft-intune)** - Track how many software licenses are available, and how many available licenses are being used.
-   **[App deployment](/intune/deploy-use/add-apps-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune)** - Deploy software to PCs that you manage. Some app management features are not available when you manage PCs with the software client.

<!-- - **Compliance settings reporting** -->

## Policies and app deployments for the Intune software client

While the Intune client software supports [management capabilities that help protect PCs](policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) by managing software updates, Windows firewall, and Endpoint Protection, PCs managed with the Intune client software cannot be targeted with other Intune policies, including those **Windows** policy settings that are specific to mobile device management.

When you use the Intune client software to manage Windows PCs, you can use only the policies shown under the **Computer Management** section.

  ![Select template for new Windows PC policy](../media/select-template-for-pc-policy.png)

When deploying apps, you can use only the Windows Installer (.exe, .msi).

## Common tasks for Windows PCs

You can use the Intune admin console to perform other common computer management tasks on Windows PCs that have the client installed:
- [Use policies to simplify PC management](use-policies-to-simplify-windows-pc-management.md) - Describes Intune's **Computer Management** policies and lists the settings for the Microsoft Intune Center.

- [View hardware and software inventory for Windows PCs](view-hardware-and-software-inventory-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) - Explains how to create a report that lists information about the hardware capabilities of PCs and the software installed on them. Also explains how to refresh PC inventory to ensure that it is current.
- [Retire a Windows PC](retire-a-windows-pc-with-microsoft-intune.md) - Lists the steps for retiring a Windows PC and describes what happens when you retire a PC.
- [Manage user-device linking for Windows PCs](manage-user-device-linking-for-windows-pcs-with-microsoft-intune.md) - Explains when and how you need to link a user to a PC before you deploy software to the user.
- [Request and provide remote assistance for Windows PCs](request-and-provide-remote-assistance-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) - Explains how Intune PC users get remote assistance help from you and describes prerequisites and TeamViewer setup.

For more information about the above tasks, see [common computer management tasks](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md).

## Management limitations of the Intune client software

Some management options, which can be used to manage PCs as mobile devices, cannot not used for PCs that are managed with the Intune client software:

-   Full wipe (selective wipe is available)
-   Conditional access

Also note that in the Intune admin console, certain sections, such as **Updates**, **Protection**, and **Licenses** appear only if you have enrolled devices using the Intune client software.

## Help with troubleshooting

The Intune client software usually runs quietly in the background without the need for much user interaction or troubleshooting. If you need to resolve PC management issues, you can check the logs. The Intune client software and corresponding logs are installed under the %Program Files%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement directory.

You can also review [Troubleshoot client setup in Microsoft Intune](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-client-setup-in-microsoft-intune) to check for issues that might occur, and any resolutions or workarounds.
