# Enroll iOS devices with Apple Configurator by using Setup Assistant

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Intune supports the enrollment of corporate-owned iOS devices using [Apple Configurator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518017) running on a Mac computer. This process resets the device to factory settings and prepares it to run Setup Assistant, installing the company's policies for the device’s new user.

## Setup Assistant enrollment for iOS devices with Microsoft Intune
Using Apple Configurator, you can reset an iOS device to factory settings and prepare it to be set up for the device’s new user. This method requires you to connect the iOS device to a Mac computer via USB to set up corporate enrollment, and it assumes you are using Apple Configurator 2.0. Most scenarios require that the policy applied to the iOS device include **user affinity** to enable the Intune Company Portal app.

**Prerequisites**
* [iOS enrollment enabled](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md) by installing an APNs certificate
* Physical access to iOS devices&mdash;devices must be reset to factory settings without password protection
* Device serial numbers&mdash;see [How to get an iOS serial number](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204308)
* USB connection cables
* A Mac computer with [Apple Configurator 2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12)


1.  **Create mobile device groups** (optional).
    If your business requires mobile device groups to help manage devices, create those groups. To learn more, see [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md).

2.  **Create a profile for devices**.
    A device enrollment profile defines the settings applied to a group of devices. The following steps show how to create a device enrollment profile for iOS devices enrolled by using Apple Configurator.

    1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then choose **Add**.
    ![Create device enrollment profile](../media/pol-sa-corp-enroll.png)

    2.  Enter details for the device profiles:

        -   **Name**&mdash;The name of the device enrollment profile (not visible to users).

        -   **Description**&mdash;A description of the device enrollment profile (not visible to users).

        -   **Enrollment Details**&mdash;Specifies how devices are enrolled.

            -   **Prompt for user affinity**&mdash;The device must be affiliated with a user during initial setup and can then be permitted to access company data and email. **User affinity** should be set up for DEP-managed devices that belong to users and need to use the company portal for services like installing apps.

            -   **No user affinity**&mdash;The device is not affiliated with a user. Use this affiliation for devices that perform tasks without accessing local user data. Apps requiring user affiliation (including the Company Portal app used for installing line-of-business apps) won’t work.

        -   **Device group pre-assignment**&mdash;All devices deployed with this profile will initially belong to this group. You can reassign devices after enrollment.

            [!INCLUDE[groups deprecated](../includes/group-deprecation.md)]

        -  **Device Enrollment Program**&mdash;The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) cannot be used with Setup Assistant enrollment. Ensure that the toggle is set to **off**.

    3.  Choose **Save Profile** to add the profile.

3.  **Add iOS devices to enroll with Setup Assistant**.
    In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate-owned Devices** &gt; **All Devices**, and then choose **Add devices**. You can add devices in two ways:

    ![Add devices dialog box](../media/pol-SA-enroll-iOS-SetupAssistant.png)

    -   **Upload a CSV file containing serial numbers**&mdash;Create a comma-separated value (.csv) list of two columns without a header, limited to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file.

        |||
        |-|-|
        |&lt;Serial #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|
        |&lt;Serial#2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|
        When viewed in a text editor, this .csv file appears as:

        ```
        0000000,PO 1234
        111111111,PO 1234
        ```

    -   **Manually add device details**&mdash;Enter the serial number and device details of up to 15 devices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must later remove corporate-owned devices from Intune management, you might need to remove the device serial number from Intune in the **By iOS Serial Number** device group under **Corporate Pre-enrolled devices** to disable device enrollment. If Intune performs a disaster recovery procedure on or around the time you remove serial numbers, you will need to verify that only active devices’ serial numbers are present in that group.

    Choose **Next**.

4.  **Select devices to enroll**.
    Confirm the devices to enroll. Serial numbers already enrolled or enrolled by other means cannot be imported. Choose **Next** to continue.

5.  **Assign profile**.
    Specify the profile to assign to added devices from the list of available profiles, review the **Enrollment profile details**, and then choose **Finish**. Manually added devices can be assigned to any enrollment profile.

6.  **Export a profile to deploy to iOS devices**.
    In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then select the device profile to deploy to mobile devices. Choose **Export** in the taskbar. Copy and save the **Profile URL**. You will upload it in Apple Configurator later to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.
    To support Apple Configurator 2, the 2.0 Profile URL must be edited. To do so, replace this code:
    ```
    https://manage.microsoft.com/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc/iOS/ESProxy?id=
    ```
    With this code:

    ```
    https://appleconfigurator2.manage.microsoft.com/MDMServiceConfig?id=
    ```

   You will upload this profile URL to the Apple DEP service using Apple Configurator in the following procedure to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.



7.  **Prepare the device with Apple Configurator**.
    iOS devices are connected to the Mac computer and enrolled for mobile device management.

    1.  On a Mac computer, open **Apple Configurator 2**. In the menu bar, choose **Apple Configurator 2**, and then choose **Preferences**.

         > [!WARNING]
         > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and turn it on. Devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you connect the device.

    2. In the preferences pane, select **Servers** and choose the plus symbol (+) to launch the MDM Server wizard. Choose **Next**.

    3. Enter the **Name** and **Enrollment URL** for the MDM server from Step #6 under Setup Assistant enrollment for iOS devices with Microsoft Intune. For the Enrollment URL, enter the enrollment profile URL exported from Intune. Choose **Next**.  

       You can safely disregard a warning stating "server URL is not verified." To continue, choose **Next** until the wizard is finished.

    4.  Connect the iOS mobile devices to the Mac computer with a USB adapter.

        > [!WARNING]
        > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and turn it on. Devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you start Setup Assistant.

    5.  Choose **Prepare**. On the Prepare iOS Device pane, select **Manual** and then choose **Next**.

    6. On the Enroll in MDM Server pane, select the server name you created, and then choose **Next**.

    7. On the Supervise Devices pane, select the level of supervision, and then choose **Next**.

    8. On the Create an Organization pane, choose the **Organization** or create a new organization, and then choose **Next**.

    9. On the Configure iOS Setup Assistant pane, choose the steps to be presented to the user, and then choose **Prepare**. If prompted, authenticate to update trust settings.  

    10. When the iOS device finishes preparing, disconnect the USB cable.  

8.  **Distribute devices**.
    The devices are now ready for corporate enrollment. Turn off the devices and distribute them to users. When users turn on their devices is, Setup Assistant will start.
