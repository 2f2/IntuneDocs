# Intune quick start guide
This guide gets you started with your paid subscription of Microsoft Intune to manage the mobile devices and Windows PCs. You can follow each step in order, or just skip ahead if a step is not applicable to your specific environment or business needs. If you want to try out Intune, see the [Intune evaluation guide](/intune/understand-explore/get-started-with-a-30-day-trial-of-microsoft-intune).  

If you're currently using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager to manage computers and servers, you can [extend Configuration Manager to manage mobile devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/mdm/understand/choose-between-standalone-intune-and-hybrid-mobile-device-management).

>[!TIP]
>If you purchase at least 150 licenses for Intune in an eligible plan, you can use the *FastTrack Center Benefit*, which is a service where Microsoft specialists work with you to get your environment ready for Intune. See [Microsoft Intune Service Benefit Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/enterprise-mobility-security/Solutions/enterprise-mobility-fasttrack-program).
