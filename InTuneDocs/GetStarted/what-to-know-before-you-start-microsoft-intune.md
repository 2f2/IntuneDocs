# What to know before you start Microsoft Intune

## General device and app management capabilities
Before you start setting up Microsoft Intune, you should first review the [Introduction to Intune](/intune/understand-explore/introduction-to-microsoft-intune) and become familiar with the capabilities of Intune described in this section. After you are familiar with the capabilities of Intune, you should be ready to set up your paid subscription. If you started with a trial subscription, you can convert it later to a full subscription. See [How to buy Microsoft Intune](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/microsoft-intune/Purchasing.aspx).

### Manage mobile devices and computers with no server or intranet requirements
You can manage the following mobile devices and computers:

-	Apple iOS 7.1 and later
-	Google Android 4.0 and later (including Samsung KNOX)
-	Windows Phone 8.0 and later
-	Windows RT and Windows 8.1 RT
-	PCs running Windows 8.1
-	PCs running Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise versions)
-	Mac OS X 10.9 and later

You can manage these devices and PCs, even if they are not joined to a domain or brought onsite. This capability makes Intune ideal for a company with a mobile or geographically distributed workforce. See [Choose how to manage devices](/Intune/Deploy-use/choose-how-to-manage-devices) for more about managing devices.

### Require encryption of mobile devices and computers
Mobile devices that support encryption can be required to use it. You can also require computers that support BitLocker drive encryption to use it. If a mobile device or computer with encryption is lost or stolen, the data on the device’s storage media is unreadable, helping to secure that data from theft.

### Generate hardware and software inventories and reports
You can gather information on the hardware and software used by your company, helping you to plan your hardware upgrade cycle or determine if unwanted software is installed on managed devices.

### Monitor mobile devices and computers
You can create alerts to notify you when there is a problem with a mobile device or a computer, and also have alerts trigger email notifications so that the right people are informed of the problem.

### Provide a “self-service” model for IT
Users can use the Company Portal to enroll devices, to install site-licensed software, or to find contact information for IT administrators.

### Support multi-factor authentication
Intune supports multi-factor authentication (MFA). For details, see [Protect Windows devices with multi-factor authentication](/intune/deploy-use/protect-windows-devices-with-multi-factor-authentication).

### Available in multiple languages
Intune is available in the following languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish. For a list of the countries where the Intune service is supported, see [International availability](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/international-availability).
