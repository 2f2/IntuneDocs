# Customize the Company Portal
The [!INCLUDE[wit_iwportal_1](../includes/wit_iwportal_1_md.md)] is where users access company data and can do common tasks like enrolling devices, installing apps, and locating information for assistance from your IT department.

> [!TIP]
> When you customize the Company Portal, the configurations apply to both the Company Portal website and Company Portal apps.

Customizing the Company Portal helps provide a familiar and helpful experience for your end users. To do it, just log into the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com) as a tenant or service administrator, choose **Admin** &gt; **Company Portal** and configure the Company Portal settings.
