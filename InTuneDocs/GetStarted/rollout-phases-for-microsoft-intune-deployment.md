# Rollout phases for Microsoft Intune
The typical phases of a technical deployment are Project Scope, Proof of Concept, Pilot, Enterprise rollout, and Run State. These are defined briefly here, with links to more information and recommendations about how to proceed through each phase.

-   [Project scope](project-scope.md): Outline your goals, timeline and success metrics, define key organizational readiness factors, assemble your project team, and begin initial preparations for all phases involved with successfully rolling out Microsoft Intune across your organization.

-   [Proof of concept](proof-of-concept.md): Test technical deployment and network architecture, and determine the ability of your deployment to meet your company's requirements. This phase includes a simple topology designed to validate specific technical scenarios.  

-   [Pilot](pilot.md): With a sample of enrolled devices, validate scenarios, resources, and rollout plans with a few users in preparation for a broad rollout.  In this phase you'll also test the technical implementation, communication plan, and training and support plans.
-   [Enterprise rollout](enterprise-rollout.md): Plan and execute your broad rollout strategy, inclusive of communications, training and support activities, then launch across all departments and user groups.

-   [Operations and maintenance](operations-and-maintenance.md): Operations plan for all key phases/focus areas, with ongoing increases in user-adoption.
