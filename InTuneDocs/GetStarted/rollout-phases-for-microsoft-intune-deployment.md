# Rollout phases for Microsoft Intune
The typical phases of a technical deployment are Project Scope, Proof of Concept, Pilot, Enterprise rollout, and Run State. These are defined briefly here, with links to more information and recommendations about how to proceed through each phase.

<!--these phase descriptions below are way too short -->

-   [Project scope](project-scope.md): Understand goals, deployment, and rollout strategy.

-   [Proof of concept](proof-of-concept.md): Test technical deployment and network architecture.

-   [Pilot](pilot.md): With a sample of enrolled devices, validate scenarios, resources, and rollout plans with a few users in preparation for a broad rollout.

-   [Enterprise rollout](enterprise-rollout.md): Launch across all departments and user groups.

-   [Operations and maintenance](operations-and-maintenance.md): Operations plan for all key phases/focus areas, with ongoing increases in user-adoption.
