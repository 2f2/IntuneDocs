# Windows PC management capabilities when you use the Intune software client
In most scenarios, you will enroll your devices with Microsoft Intune, which provides a greater set of capabilities. However, you can also manage PCs by using the Intune software client, which provides the following features:

-   **[Software update management](/intune/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)** - You can keep PCs up to date and decide when updates are applied.

-   **[Windows Firewall policy](/intune/deploy-use/help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune)** - This helps to ensure that no PC that's used in your company has an inactive or improperly-configured Windows Firewall.

-   **[Anti-malware protection](/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune)** - Intune includes Endpoint Protection, which helps protect your PCs from malware.

-   **[Remote assistance](/intune/deploy-use/common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client#request-and-provide-remote-assistance-to-windows-pcs-that-use-the-intune-client-software )** - Intune lets users contact IT support staff, who can then provide assistance by using a remote desktop feature that is included with Intune (requires TeamViewer software).

-   **[Software license management](/intune/deploy-use/manage-license-agreements-for-windows-pc-software-in-microsoft-intune)** - Track how many software licenses are available, and how many available licenses are being used.
-   **[App deployment](/intune/deploy-use/add-apps-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune)** - Deploy software to PCs that you manage. Some app management features are not available when you manage PCs with the software client.
