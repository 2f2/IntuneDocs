# Create policies and publish an app to evaluation users

Intune policies provide settings that help you control the security settings on mobile devices, maintain Windows Firewall and Endpoint Protection settings for computers, and deploy applications. If you are planning to use Intune for devices that you configure for production use after the evaluation, it's absolutely essential that you follow the instructions in [Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](/intune/deploy-use/manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies) and [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune).

You can perform two types of app installations using Intune. The first is a **required install**, which automatically deploys the app to managed devices. The other is an **available install**, which deploys the app, or a link to the app, to the Intune Company Portal so that users can choose whether to install it on their computers or on their mobile devices.

Before using Intune to deploy apps, make sure that you have the appropriate licenses to publish, distribute, and use the app. The **Licenses** workspace lets you add and manage license agreement information for apps or software purchased through Microsoft Volume Licensing agreements, and for Microsoft or non-Microsoft apps or software purchased by other means. You can then create license reports, which display managed license usage information throughout your company, to stay informed of license usage activity.

In these steps, you'll set up a mobile device configuration policy and a Windows computer firewall policy, and configure Skype as an available install for mobile devices after they're enrolled. After you add and deploy a new policy, all users or devices in the group to which you deployed the policy inherit the settings as their baseline policy. You can always review and edit the details of these policies later from the **Policy** workspace in the administration console.

## Create and deploy a mobile device configuration policy

1.  Open the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/).

2.  In the left pane, choose the **Policy** icon.

3.  In the **Tasks** list on the **Policy Overview** page, choose **Add Policy**.

4.  In the policy list, expand the platform you want to create a policy for, select **General Configuration**, choose **Create and Deploy a Custom Policy**, and then choose **Create Policy**.

5.  When prompted to **Select the groups to which you want to deploy this policy**, select **My Trial Users** from the list, and choose **Add** &gt; **OK**.

Your policy appears in the list of configuration policies, and has been deployed to the **My Trial Users** group. Double-click the policy to view its settings.

## Publish the Skype app for mobile devices

1.  In the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose the **Apps** icon, then choose **Apps** &gt; **Add App**. If prompted, enter your Intune credentials.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you start the **Intune Software Publisher** for the first time, a short delay occurs while the application is installed.

2.  Review the security warning, and choose **Run**.

3.  On the **Before you begin** page, choose **Next**.

4.  On the **Software setup** page in **Select how this software is made available to devices**, select **External link**.

5.  Enter the external link for the software in **Specify the URL**, and then choose **Next**. Make sure that you preface the URL with **https://**. For the Skype app, use the link below that matches the mobile device platform you're using:

    -   **iOS:** [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt%3D8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt%3D8)

    -   **Android:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider)

    -   **Windows Phone 8.1:** [http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51)

6.  On the **Software description** page, provide the information that you want users to see in the Company Portal for the software, and then choose **Next**. The following settings are available (this example refers to Skype):

    -   **Publisher:** Enter the name of the publisher, **Microsoft**

    -   **Name:** Enter **Skype**

    -   **Description:** Enter a description for the software, such as **Skype communication app**

    -   **Category:** Select the category that best fits this software, such as **Collaboration**

    -   **Display this as a featured app and highlight it in the company portal:** Select this option to display the app prominently in the Company Portal on mobile devices.

    -   **Icon:**  (Optional) Choose whether to associate an icon with the software. The maximum icon size is 250 x 250 pixels, but the recommended icon size is 32 x 32 pixels.

7.  On the **Summary** page, verify the software information, and then choose **Upload**. Choose **Close** to exit the wizard.

8.  In the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Apps** &gt; **Apps** &gt; **Skype** &gt; **Manage Deployment**.

9. On the **Select Groups** page, select **My Trial Users** to deploy the software to that user group, and then choose **Add** &gt; **Next**.

10. On the **Deployment Action** page, select **Available Install** from the **Approval** column for your group.

11. Choose **Finish**.

## Install the Skype app
Open the Company Portal on the mobile device, choose **Apps**, and then install Microsoft Skype.
