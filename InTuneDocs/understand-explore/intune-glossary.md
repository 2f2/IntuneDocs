## A

|||
|-|-|
|App SDK|The [Microsoft Intune App SDK](/intune/develop/intune-app-sdk) lets you add functionality to your in-house written apps that enables them to be managed by Intune mobile application management policies.|
|App Wrapping Tool|A [command line application](/intune/deploy-use/decide-how-to-prepare-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-microsoft-intune) that creates a wrapper around a line of business app, which then allows the app to be managed by an Intune mobile application management policy.|
|Available install|When you deploy an app with this action, it is displayed in the company portal, and users can [install it on demand](/intune/deploy-use/deploy-apps).|
|Azure Portal|A new console for Intune which will be introduced soon. At the moment, you can use the Azure portal to create [Intune MAM policies](/intune/deploy-use/azure-portal-for-microsoft-intune-mam-policies) for devices.|

## B
|||
|-|-|
|BYOD|[Bring your own device](/intune/get-started/choose-how-to-enroll-devices1). Users can install the Intune Company Portal app on their device and then enroll it, gaining access to company resources like email, company apps, company data, and support.|

## C
|||
|-|-|
|Certificate profile|You use this policy type to [secure access to corporate resources](/intune/deploy-use/secure-resource-access-with-certificate-profiles) with certificates when you use Wi-Fi, email, or VPN profiles.|
|Cloud storage space|A place where apps, or the data about apps you create [is stored](/intune/deploy-use/add-apps#cloud-storage-space).|
|COD|[Company owned devices](/intune/get-started/choose-how-to-enroll-devices1) can be enrolled in a variety of ways, depending upon the needs of the organization and the types of devices being managed.|
|Company Portal|An app or a website that provides users with [access to company data and apps](/intune/get-started/microsoft-intune-company-portal).|
|Compliance policy|Makes sure that the devices used to access company apps and data, [comply with certain rules ](/intune/deploy-use/introduction-to-device-compliance-policies-in-microsoft-intune)like using a PIN to access the device, and encryption of data stored on the device.|
|Compliant and noncompliant apps|Part of a [general configuration policy](/intune/deploy-use/manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies), these settings let you define a list of apps that users can, or cannot run. Intune will then inform you via. reports that a noncompliant app was installed, or run. For some platforms, Intune can also block install of a noncompliant app.|
|Conditional access|[Allows access to company email, Office 365, and other  services](/intune/deploy-use/restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune) only from devices that are compliant with rules you set.|
|Custom policy|You [use these policies](/intune/deploy-use/manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies) when a general configuration policy does not contain a built-in setting that meets your needs. You might be able to use a custom policy to create a setting by other means like the Apple Configurator, or OMA-URI.|

|Device group mapping|Helps you to [automatically add devices to groups](/intune/deploy-use/categorize-devices-with-device-group-mapping-in-microsoft-intune) based on a category of device (like "Personal", or "Sales") that you, or the end user can assign to the device.|

## E

|Requirements|An [app deployment operation](/en-us/intune/deploy-use/add-apps) that lets you select the requirements that must be met on a device before the app is installed. For example, you could specify the OS version of iOS that must be installed before the app gets installed.|

## S
|||
|-|-|
|Selective wipe|A [selective wipe](/intune/deploy-use/use-remote-wipe-to-help-protect-data-using-microsoft-intune) removes only company data including mobile app management (MAM) data where applicable, settings, and email profiles from a device.
