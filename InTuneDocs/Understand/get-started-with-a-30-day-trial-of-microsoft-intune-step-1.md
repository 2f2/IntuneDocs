# Sign up for a 30-day evaluation of Microsoft Intune

Setting up a free Microsoft Intune 30-day evaluation to manage your mobile devices and computers is quick and easy. With just a few simple steps in the evaluation, you can add up to 100 users and devices, set up groups, configure compliance policies, and enroll and manage mobile devices and computers. In this topic, you'll learn the basics  to get an Intune evaluation up and running and get an overview of the service so you can evaluate Intune's features and capabilities.

## What to consider before you sign up

Before  you sign up or sign in to Intune,  you should consider the following:

-   Whether your organization already has a Microsoft Online Services work or school account

-   Whether you have an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement with Microsoft

-   Whether you plan to use the Intune tenant after the 30-day evaluation

|Sign up for a NEW account if either of the following is true:|Sign in with your WORK or SCHOOL account if:|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|**You don’t have a work or school account.** A work or school account is provided when you sign a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft or subscribe to Office 365. If your organization has not signed an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement with Microsoft (or has an Office 365 account), then you do not have a Microsoft Online Services account that you can use to sign in to Microsoft Online Services.<br /><br />**You will discard your Intune tenant after completing the 30-day evaluation.** You should sign up for a new account if you are using your Intune free evaluation subscription for evaluation purposes only, and you plan to redo your Intune service setup and device provisioning after the evaluation. This is the recommended option if you plan to use Intune with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.<br /><br />If you sign up for a new account, you cannot change later to using an existing work or school account to manage that account, or combine it with existing volume licensing agreements.|**You have a work or school account provided with a volume licensing agreement or Office 365 subscription, and you are using this evaluation to evaluate Intune.**<br /><br />If you are setting up Intune on an existing account, we recommend that you review [Choose how to manage devices](choose-how-to-manage-devices.md) before continuing with these steps.|

## Sign up or sign in to Intune

1.  First, [click here to visit the Intune Sign up page](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20).

2.  On the **Sign up** page, you have two options:

    -   **Subscribe using your Microsoft Online Services work or school account**: Click **Sign in** if you already have a work or school account, and you want to use the same account to subscribe to both services. When you use the same account for multiple services, those services use the same Azure AD infrastructure and are tenants of Azure AD. Azure AD provides the core directory and identity management capabilities for Microsoft cloud services.

    -   **Subscribe to Intune only**: If you do not yet subscribe to a cloud service, complete the form on the sign-up page to subscribe to Intune.

        > [!NOTE]
        > By default, the domain name is associated with your subscription and user accounts that you add to Intune. After you subscribe, you can add and use a custom domain name that you already own, or continue to use the free **onmicrosoft.com** domain.

After you complete the sign-up form and accept the Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement, you're automatically signed in to the Office 365 admin center with the tenant administrator account. An email message that contains your account information is also sent to the email address that you provided during sign-up. This email confirms that your subscription is active.
