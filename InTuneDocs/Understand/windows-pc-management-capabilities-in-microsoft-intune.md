# Windows PC management capabilities (with the Microsoft Intune PC client)
In most scenarios, you will enroll your devices with Microsoft Intune, which provides a greater set of capabilities than the Intune PC client. However, you can also manage PCs by using the Intune PC client which provides the following features:

-   **Manage software updates** - You can keep PCs up-to-date, and manage when updates are applied.

-   **Windows Firewall policy** - This helps to ensure that no PC used by your company has an inactive or improperly-configured Windows Firewall.

-   **Anti-malware protection** - Intune includes Endpoint Protection, which helps protect your PCs from malware.

-   **Remote assistance** - Intune lets users contact IT support staff, who can then provide assistance using a remote desktop feature that is included with Intune.

-   **Software license management** - Track how many software licenses are available, and how many available licenses are being used.
-   **App deployment** - Deploy software to PCs that you manage. Some app management features are not available when you manage PCs with the client software.
