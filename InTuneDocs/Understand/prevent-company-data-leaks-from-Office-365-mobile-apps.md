# Quick Start Guide: Prevent company data leaks from Office 365 mobile apps
Microsoft Intune can help you secure your organization’s data using mobile application management (MAM) policies that help prevent company data leaks from Office 365 mobile apps or other line of business (LOB) apps. Intune MAM policies can be used without requiring end users to enroll their devices in Intune mobile device management (MDM). So, if you have users who do not want to enroll their BYOD iOS or Android mobile devices into a Microsoft MDM solution (Intune, Configuration Manager, or EAS), you want to protect corporate data without managing end users devices, or you are already using a non-Microsoft MDM solution, Intune can help you increase your company’s data security.   

## Is this quick start guide right for you?
Would you like to allow your end users to access your Office 365 and LOB app data on their iOS and Android devices without requiring device enrollment in a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, but still control what they can or cannot do with that data such as copying and pasting it onto personal apps?

If yes, Microsoft Intune allows you to set MAM policies for Office 365 mobile apps on iOS and Android, including cut/copy/paste restrictions, preventing ‘save-as’, setting PIN requirements, and the ability to remotely wipe MAM protected data.  This protects company data without requiring users to enroll their devices into an MDM solution while maintaining a great end-user experience with Office mobile apps.

## How to implement this scenario
1.	Get a basic understanding of [how Intune mobile application management (MAM)](/intune/deployuse/protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune) works.
2.	Find out [what you need to do before you can create MAM policies](/intune/deployuse/get-ready-to-configure-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune) in the Azure portal.
3.	[Create and deploy MAM policies](/intune/deployuse/get-ready-to-configure-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune) with Intune.
