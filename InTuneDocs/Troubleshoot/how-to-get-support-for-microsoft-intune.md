Our initial responses to service requests depend on the severity of the issue. For the most severe issues, our first response for Professional customers will be within two hours. For Premier Support customers, the response will vary according to your support agreement. These are cases where:

- One or more services arenâ€™t accessible or are unusable. 
- Production, operations, or deployment deadlines are severely affected, or there will be a severe impact on production or profitability. 
- Multiple users or services are affected.

For moderately severe issues, our first response for Professional customers will be within four hours. For Premier Support customers, the response will vary according to your support agreement.  These are cases where:

- The service is usable but in an impaired fashion. 
- The situation has moderate business impact and can be dealt with during business hours. 
- A single user, customer, or service is partially affected.

For other issues, our first response for Professional customers will be within eight hours. For Premier Support customers, the response will vary according to your support agreement.  These are cases where:

- The situation has minimal business impact. 
- The issue is important but does not have a significant current service or productivity impact for the customer. 
- A single user is experiencing partial disruption, but an acceptable workaround exists.
