# How to get support for Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Support provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Intune. Support is available both online and by telephone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Non-technical support is available in additional languages.

This topic tells you how to open a service request or call for phone support in many languages.

For self help with Intune, see [General troubleshooting tips for Microsoft Intune](general-troubleshooting-tips-for-microsoft-intune.md) or any of the troubleshooting topics for specific issues, listed in the **See also** section of this topic.
## Create an online service request

1.  Sign in to Intune and then visit the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/Support/SupportEntry.aspx).

2.  Under the heading **Create a service request** select the category of issue for which you want to open a ticket:

    -   For billing and licensing issues select **Billing and product info**.

    -   For all other Intune issues select **Mobile device management**. This option also covers Office 365 MDM and System Center Configuration Manager with Intune.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may have to click **more** at the bottom of the list to see all of the categories.

3.  On the **identify the issue** page select the **Feature** and **Symptom** for which you need help. You will be asked to provide an **Issue summary** and **Issue details**.

4.  On the **review suggestions** page you'll find links to content that may help you resolve the issue on your own.  If you can't resolve the issue you can click **Yes, continue** at the bottom of the page to submit your service request.

5.  On the **add details** page provide the requested information. You can attach screenshots or other documents by clicking **attach a file**.

6.  On the **confirm and submit** page provide contact information, review your request, and click **Submit request**. After the request is submitted you will be taken to a list of your service requests.

## Support by phone
See [Contact Assisted Phone Support for Microsoft Intune](contact-assisted-phone-support-for-microsoft-intune.md) for a list of support phone numbers by country and region, support hours, and supported languages for each region.

## Track your service requests
To track your requests, go to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx). At the bottom of the **Create a service request** list, click **See all support tickets**. By default, you will see all of your service requests that are in an open state. To change which service requests you see, for example, to see closed requests, click  the filter icon in the top navigation and select your preferred view.

> [!NOTE]
> **If you use Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager** or **Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection:** For technical support with Configuration Manager or Endpoint Protection, contact your partner or visit the [Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager and System Center Endpoint Protection Solution Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/system-center-2012-r2/resources.aspx) to find rich self-help material, with the option of opening a support request online or over the phone.

## Responding to support cases
We prioritize the support cases we receive so that we can take care of the most urgent cases most quickly. To help us prioritize support cases we give each case a severity level shown in the following table. You can also see response times for each severity level.

**Initial Response Times:**

|Severity Level|Operations and Support Description|Microsoft Intune / Enterprise Mobility Suite<br /><br />Premier|Microsoft Intune / Enterprise Mobility Suite<br /><br />Professional|
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Sev A (Critical)|One or more services aren’t accessible or are unusable. Production, operations, or deployment deadlines are severely affected, or there will be a severe impact on production or profitability. Multiple users or services are affected.|1 Hour|2 Hours|
|Sev B (High)|The service is usable but in an impaired fashion. The situation has moderate business impact and can be dealt with during business hours. A single user, customer, or service is partially affected.|2 Hours|4 Hours|
|Sev C (Medium)|The situation has minimal business impact. The issue is important but does not have a significant current service or productivity impact for the customer. A single user is experiencing partial disruption, but an acceptable workaround exists.|4 Hours|8 Hours|

## Support partnership
Successful technical support depends on the partnership between Microsoft support and your organization's IT department.  Initial troubleshooting efforts in your organization, combined with effective communication between your admins and Microsoft, can help resolve issues quickly.

### How your administrators can help
People with Intune administrator roles (including tenant administrators and service administrators) are authorized to access the Intune Administration console and to communicate directly with Microsoft about Intune service requests. These administrators can also include Microsoft partners that you have specified as delegated administrators.

The administrator:

-   Manages service administration and account maintenance

-   Submits service requests to Microsoft

-   Provides user account setup and configuration to allow users access to the services

-   Manages client connectivity and software installation issues

-   Manages service availability issues within your organization

-   Uses Microsoft’s self-service support resources to resolve support issues

Microsoft Support is here to assist you should your issue persist in spite of your troubleshooting efforts.

### How Microsoft Support can help
Our role is to:

-   Troubleshoot, manage, and resolve customer issues and escalations

-   Gather and validate information related to specific service requests

-   Provide issue coordination and resolution management

-   Maintain communication with your administrators to help ensure that issues are addressed on an ongoing basis

-   Provide assistance with licensing, invoicing, and subscription inquiries

-   Provide assistance with purchasing and trial inquiries

-   Continually gather customer feedback on how to improve the service through surveys
