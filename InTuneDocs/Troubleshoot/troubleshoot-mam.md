Please follow instructions in [Enable your tenant for modern authentication](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx) to set up modern authentication for Skype.

**Issue:** MAM without Enrollment policies are not applying to any [supported Office App(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-partners) for any user.

Resolution: Confirm that the user is licensed for Intune.

Resolution:
The following roles have access to the Azure Portal:

- Global administrator, which you can set up in the [Office Portal](http://portal.office.com/)
- Owner, which you can set up in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Contributor, which you can set up in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

**Issue:** App report does not show user(s) we recently targeted MAM policy to.

Resolution: If a user is newly targeted with a MAM policy, it can take up to 24 hours for that user to show up in reports as a targeted user.

**Issue:** Policy changes/updates can take up to 8 hours to apply.  

Resolution: End user can log out of the app and log back in to force sync with service .  

**Issue:** MAM policy is not applying to Apple DEP devices

Resolution: Please ensure you are using User Affinity with Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP). User Affinity is required for any app that requires user authentication under DEP.
