# General troubleshooting tips for Microsoft Intune
You may find  after you deploy [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)], that you're encountering problems with your configuration or with clients. The resources below may help you find out what could be causing the problem so that you can resolve it.

> [!NOTE]

## Tips
Here are some general troubleshooting tips that can help you resolve issues in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)].

Start by **defining the problem**:

-   What is the behavior?

-   Who experiences this behavior, and on what platforms and devices?

-   Did the device work properly previously?

-   What changes did you make to the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] or device configuration?

-   Consider whether other changes were made to the environment in which you operate, other than configuration changes.

-   How frequently does this problem occur, and is it sporadic or consistent?

-   Could the user be experiencing an authentication issue? If this is a possiblity, check if the user can log in to other services that use Azure Active Directory. Also, see if the user can log in from a different device.

After you've defined the problem, **collect available data**. This can include:

-   Device logs. Learn how to collect device logs in [Intune: sending troubleshooting info to IT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46391).

-   Admin console data, for example, for policy implementation issues you should examine the intended policy and the status of that policy, as described in [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md).

After you've defined the problem and collected data you can **research the solution**:

-   Search the Web for a solution. For example, if you receive the error 0x80073CF0, you can search for **technet intune 0x80073cf0** on the Web, and find the article [Troubleshoot app deployment problems in Microsoft Intune](troubleshoot-app-deployment-problems-in-microsoft-intune.md), which offers suggestions for addressing this issue.

-   You can search for an answer in the [Intune TechNet forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=microsoftintuneprod).  If the issue has not been previously addressed you should post the question to see what suggestions the community might have.

-   You can open a support request. Intune Support will be better able to help you resolve an issue when you've defined the problem and have collected the available data.
