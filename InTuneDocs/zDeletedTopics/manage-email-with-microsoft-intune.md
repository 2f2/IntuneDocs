# Manage email with Microsoft Intune

Email is a common way to access company data on a mobile device.  That data is shared in the body and attachments of email.
Microsoft Intune has several features that help you protect your data while allowing use of mobile devices to read and send email.

Many mobile platforms include a *native* email client that ships as part of the
operating system.  These clients may be configurable using [email profiles](configure-access-to-corporate-email-using-email-profiles-with-microsoft-intune.md).

If you need additional data loss prevention (DLP), choose [Conditional access](manage-access-to-email-and-sharepoint-with-microsoft-intune.md), which controls access to the user's
 mailbox for any email client, including native email clients .
>Note:

>You may choose to deploy an email client with more DLP capabilities.  The
Microsoft Outlook client also supports:
-  Application level DLP using Intune mobile app management
-  File level DLP, using Azure Rights Management Services.
