# Mobile device management capabilities (for enrolled devices)  in Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] lets you manage a range of devices by *enrolling* them into the service. Users can then use a *company portal* to perform a range of operations such as enrolling their device, browsing and installing apps, making sure their device is compliant with company policies, and contacting their IT support.
See later in this topic for a full list of the capabilities that enrolling devices gives you.

## When to enroll devices
For mobile device operating systems including iOS, Android and Windows Phone, you must always enroll devices. For Windows PCs, you can choose between enrolling them, or installing the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] PC client software which offers a few capabilities not available when you enroll devices.
Review the information in this topic and in the [Windows PC management capabilities (with the Microsoft Intune computer client)](windows-pc-management-capabilities-in-microsoft-intune.md) topic to help you decide which method you will use to manager you Windows PCs.

## <a name="BKMK_MobileDeviceReqs"></a>Requirements for device management
### Operating systems

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage the following device platforms:

- Apple iOS 7.1 and later
- Google Android 4.0 and later (including Samsung KNOX)
- Windows Phone 8.0 and later
- Windows RT and Windows 8.1 RT
- PCs running Windows 8.1 and later
- Mac OS X 10.9 and later

<div class="alert alert-tip">
  <h5><span class="icon-tip"></span> Tip</h5>
  <p>If you previously enrolled devices that run an earlier version of iOS than the supported version above, these will remain enrolled. However, check the documentation for each [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] to ensure that version of iOS is supported by the feature.</p>
</div>

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage users' devices, popularly known as "bring your own device" (BYOD). It can also manage company-owned devices including scenarios where the company provides a list of devices users may choose from, known as "choose your own device" (CYOD).

How you enroll devices depends on your organization's needs:

|Enrollment type|BYOD|CYOD|Shared device with manager account|Shared device without a user account|
|-------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|**Description**|Personal device enrolled using Microsoft Intune|Corporate-owned device for single user|Corporate-owned device managed using a manager account shared by many users|Corporate-owned user-less device used by many users.|
|**Deviceâ€™s user**|Owner|Assigned user|No user-specific account|No specific user|
|**Who enrolls?**|Owner|Administrator|Device Manager|Anyone|
|**Who un-enrolls?**|Owner or administrator|Administrator|Administrator|Administrator|
|**Who can reset?**|Owner or administrator|Administrator|Administrator|Administrator|


###Exchange ActiveSync management
You can also manage devices by using Exchange ActiveSync. This requires you to install the On-Premises Connector or use the built-in Service to Service Connector to connect to your Exchange Server.

To learn about the hardware and software requirements to install the On-Premises Connector, see [Requirements for the On-Premises Connector](network-infrastructure-requirements-for-microsoft-intune.md).

To learn about using the On-Premises Connector or Service to Service Connector with Exchange, see [Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Microsoft Intune](mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune.md).

## Mobile device management features


Management, inventory, app deployment, provisioning, and retirement are all handled through the [!INCLUDE[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] administration console. Users gain access to the company portal which allows them to install apps, enroll and remove devices, and helps them contact their IT department or helpdesk.

**Mobile device management (MDM) capabilities** include the following:

### Device security and configuration

|Capability|Details|More information|
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
|Configuration policies<br><br>Custom policies|Mobile device configuration policies let you manage many settings and features on mobile devices in your organization. For example, you can you require a password, limit the number of failed attempts, limit the minutes before the screen locks, set password expiration, and prevent previously-used passwords. You could also control the use of hardware and software features such as the device camera, or the web browser<br><br>Use custom polices when configuration policies do not contain the setting you require. For iOS devices, you can import settings you exported from the Apple Configurator Tool. For other devices, you can use OMA-URI settings to configure settings and features on the device.|[Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md)<br />|
|Remote Wipe, Remote Lock, and Passcode Reset|Erase sensitive data when a device is lost or stolen. For example, you can remotely lock the device, restore it to factory settings, or wipe only corporate data.<br>You can reset passcodes if users lose access to their device, lock missing or stolen devices, or even wipe data off of missing or stolen devices.|[Help protect your data with remote wipe, remote lock, or passcode reset using Microsoft Intune](help-protect-your-data-with-remote-wipe,-remote-lock,-or-passcode-reset-using-microsoft-intune.md)|
|Kiosk mode|Lets you lock down certain features of mobile devices such as screen capture and the power switch. Also lets you restrict devices to run a single app that you specify.|[iOS configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune](ios-configuration-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)|

### App management

|Capability|Details|More information|
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
|App deployment and management|Provides a range of tools to help you manage mobile apps through their lifecycle, including app deployment from installation files and app stores, detailed monitoring of app status, and app removal.|[Deploy apps to mobile devices in Microsoft Intune](deploy-apps-to-mobile-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md)|
|Compliant and noncompliant apps|Lets you specify lists of compliant apps (that users are allowed to install) and noncompliant apps (which must not be installed by users).|[iOS configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune](ios-configuration-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md)|
|Mobile application management|Configure restrictions for apps by using mobile application management for both devices you manage with Intune, and also devices that are not managed by Intune. This helps you to increase the security of your company data by restricting operations such as copy and paste, external backup of data and the transfer of data between apps.|[Configure and deploy mobile application management policies in the Microsoft Intune console](configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console.md)<br><br>[Configure data loss prevention app policies with Microsoft Intune](configure-data-loss-prevention-app-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md)<br /><br />[Prepare iOS apps for mobile application management with the Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool](prepare-ios-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-the-microsoft-intune-app-wrapping-tool.md)<br /><br />[Prepare Android apps for mobile application management with the Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool](prepare-android-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-the-microsoft-intune-app-wrapping-tool.md)|
|Mobile app configuration|Use mobile app configuration policies to supply settings for iOS apps that might be required when the user runs the app. For example, an app might require the user to specify a port number of logon information. This can help streamline app configuration and reduce the number of help desk calls.|[Configure apps with mobile app configuration policies in Microsoft Intune](configure-apps-with-mobile-app-configuration-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md)|
|Managed browser|After you deploy the managed browser to your users, you can configure a managed browser policy to control the websites that they can visit.
