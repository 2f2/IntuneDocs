# Migrating to Intune - Pilot Intune

>[!NOTE]
>This topic is part of a larger migration guide. If you'd like to start at the beginning of the guide, check out the [main topic](migrating-to-intune.md).

Now you’re ready to start your pilot deployment of Intune with selected users and devices. Remember, the devices you test in the pilot deployment need to be unenrolled from your existing enterprise mobility management platform before they are enrolled in Intune.

Your pilot deployment should validate:

- Users and devices can be successfully enrolled and unenrolled in Intune
- Intune configuration policies are created and tested on devices 
- Intune compliance policies are created and tested on devices
- Intune conditional access is functioning properly
- Intune managed applications are created and installed on devices
- Intune mobile application management policies are created and tested on devices
- Corporate resources such as VPN, Wi-Fi, email, and certificates are provisioned and tested as applicable

A typical pilot may last for several weeks and should include an appropriate number of users and devices based on the size of your organization. You should use this time to train your IT staff on how to enroll and troubleshoot problems for all of the platforms you’ll support.  

Additionally, you should consider feedback from your pilot users in developing your user enrollment documentation and communications for your full-scale deployment of Intune.
After you’ve tested and validated your pilot deployment of Intune, you’re ready to schedule the migration of the rest of the users and devices in your organization to Intune.
