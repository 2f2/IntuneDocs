# Choose how to manage Windows PCs

## Enroll as a device
As a cloud-based MDM service, Intune provides deep device and app management capabilities for managing mobile devices (iOS & Mac devices, Android devices, Windows phones) and Windows PCs. Additionally, Intune enables you to secure your devices and apps at a more granular level by using certificates, profiles for Wi-Fi, VPN, and email to allow secure access to specific corporate resources, deploying apps to usersâ€™ devices, and restricting certain actions on managed apps.  


## ActivSync
To help you decide between Intune standalone-v-ActivSync, read the [choose how to manage devices](choose-manage-devices.md) topic.


## Next steps
Read the [Introduction to Intune](/intune/understand-explore/introduction-to-microsoft-intune.md) if you want to learn more about Intune as a standalone solution for enterprise mobility.
