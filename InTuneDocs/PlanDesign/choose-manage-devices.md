# Choose how to manage devices

## Intune
As a cloud-based MDM service, Intune provides deep device and app management capabilities for managing mobile devices (iOS & Mac devices, Android devices, Windows phones) and Windows PCs. Additionally, Intune enables you to secure your devices and apps at a more granular level by using certificates, profiles for Wi-Fi, VPN, and email to allow secure access to specific corporate resources, deploying apps to usersâ€™ devices, and restricting certain actions on managed apps.
