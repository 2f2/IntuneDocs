# Ways to do enterprise mobility

Microsoft provides several options for managing your mobile devices. Depending on the type of devices you need to manage, the granularity of device and app management your business requires, and other factors such as cost, you may choose one of the mobile device management (MDM) solutions provided by Microsoft.

## Choose the Microsoft MDM solution that is right for you
As a cloud-based MDM service, Intune provides deep device and app management capabilities for managing mobile devices (iOS & Mac devices, Android devices, Windows phones) and Windows PCs. Additionally, Intune enables you to secure your devices and apps at a more granular level by using certificates, profiles for Wi-Fi, VPN, and email to allow secure access to specific corporate resources, deploying apps to usersâ€™ devices, and restricting certain actions on managed apps.  

You can also extend System Center Configuration Manager to use Intune to manage mobile devices using the Configuration Manager console. This hybrid MDM experience enables you to continue using your on-premises infrastructure to manage both mobile devices and PCs, while keeping existing policies and configurations intact.  

To help you decide between Intune standalone and Intune integrated with Configuration Manager for hybrid MDM, read the [choose an MDM solution](choose-mdm-solution.md).
