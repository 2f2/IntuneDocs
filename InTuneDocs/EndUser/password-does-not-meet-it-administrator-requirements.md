# Password does not meet IT administrator requirements

Your password does not meet one or more requirements that your IT administrator set up for your device. Depending on the policies that your IT administrator created, you could be having one or a combination of these issues:

- Password does not contain complex characters
- Password is too simple and not secure enough
- Password has expired
- Password is not set
- Password is too short
- Password was used too recently
- Password isn't complex enough to meet requirements

If you have trouble figuring out how to make your password comply with the requirements, contact your IT administrator.

For information about setting your PIN or password, or for other tasks that you can do with your device, use the link that matches the type of device you have:

- [Set or change your passcode](set-or-change-your-passcode-ios.md)</br>
