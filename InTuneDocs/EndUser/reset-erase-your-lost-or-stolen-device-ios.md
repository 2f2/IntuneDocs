# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device

If a phone that has been enrolled in Intune is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory default settings by using the Company Portal app from a different device or by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).

> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factory defaults removes both your personal and work information from your device. For more about what happens when you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-ios.md).

To reset your device using the Company Portal app:

1.  In the Company Portal app, under **My Devices**,  select the device you want to erase.

2.  Tap  **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.

To reset your device using the Company Portal website, use these steps, or watch this [video](http://aka.ms/jhdjak):

1.  In the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com), select the device you want to erase.

2.  Tap  **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.
> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, ask your IT administrator to reset it for you. If you can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
