# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen iOS device

If a phone that has been enrolled in Intune is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory default settings by using the Company Portal app from a different device or by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).

> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factory defaults removes both your personal and work information from your device. For more about what happens when you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-ios.md).

2.  Under **My Devices**, select the lost or stolen device.

3.  Tap **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.
