# Use verbose logging to help your IT administrator fix device issues

When your Android device is enrolled in Intune, you can use the **Verbose Logging** setting to make the Company Portal app and Intune-managed apps record detailed logs about what's happening on your device. These logs help your IT admin fix any issues that you might have when you're using the Company Portal or an app that's managed by Intune. Verbose logging is enabled on your device  by default, and the  logs that are sent to your IT admin include your email address.

To turn verbose logging on or off, sign in to the Company Portal app using your work or school credentials, tap **Settings**, and tap the on/off button next to the **Verbose Logging** setting.

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
