# Enroll your Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1 device in Intune

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your devices to get access to company email, files, and other resources. Enrolling your devices enables your organization to keep corporate data secure. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md) and [What your IT administrator can and can't see on your device](what-can-your-it-administrator-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md).


To enroll your Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1 device:

1.  On the device, tap **Settings** &gt; **PC Settings** &gt; **Network** &gt; **Workplace**.

2.  Enter your work or school email for the User ID, if required, and then tap **Join**.

    If your user ID is not required,  the email address that you entered when you logged into this device is used.

3.  Type the password for your work or school email.

We also recommend that you install the Company Portal app, which lets you easily identify and get the company apps that are relevant to you and your role. Depending on how your company  configured Intune, the Company Portal app may have been installed as part of your enrollment process. To check if you have the app, look for **Company Portal** in your apps list. If you don't see the Company Portal in your list of apps, follow these steps to install it.

1.  Tap **Start** &gt; **Store**.

2.  Tap **Search** and type **company portal**.

3.  In the list of results, tap **Company Portal**.

4.  Tap  either **Install** or **Free**. The option shown depends on how your company configured the app.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
