We also recommend that you install the Company Portal app, which lets you easily identify and get the company apps that are relevant to you and your role. Depending on how your company  configured Intune, the Company Portal app may have been installed as part of your enrollment process. To check if you have the app, look for **Company Portal** in your apps list. If you don't see the Company Portal in your list of apps, follow these steps to install it.

1.  Tap **Start** &gt; **Store**.

2.  Tap **Search** and type **company portal**.

3.  In the list of results, tap **Company Portal**.

4.  Tap  either **Install** or **Free**. The option shown depends on how your company configured the app.
