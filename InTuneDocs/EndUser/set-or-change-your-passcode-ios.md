# Set or change your passcode

If your iOS device doesn't comply with your IT administrator's passcode policy, a message appears that briefly describes the issue and explains what you need to do to make your passcode meet the requirements.

Your IT administrator can set more than one passcode requirement. For example, the passcode might have to be a certain number of characters, and it might have to be a mix of numbers and letters, etc. Since more than one requirement might be set, these instructions can explain only how to set or change your passcode. They don't explain every possible combination of requirements. 

If you have trouble setting a passcode that meets all of the passcode requirements, contact your IT administrator for help.

## To set your passcode:

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. On the **Touch ID & Passcode** menu, tap **Turn Passcode** On.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your IT administrator's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.

## To change your passcode:

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. Enter your passcode. The Touch ID & Passcode menu opens.
2. Tap **Change Passcode** and enter your old password.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your IT administrator's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
