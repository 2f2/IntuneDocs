# Encrypt your Windows device

To protect your company or school data, your IT administrator might require you to encrypt your Windows device. If you have a Windows Phone, and you have enrolled it, your device will be encrypted automatically if encryption is required.

If you have a desktop device, follow the instructions below to encrypt it.

1.  Search for, and then start, the **Manage BitLocker** app.

2.  Click **Turn on BitLocker**, and then follow the instructions shown to encrypt each of your drives.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
