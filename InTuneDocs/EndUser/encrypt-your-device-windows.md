# Encrypt your Windows device

Your IT admin might require you to encrypt your Windows device to protect company or school data. If you have a Windows phone and have enrolled it, your device will be encrypted automatically if encryption is required.

If you have a desktop device, the following instructions describe how to encrypt it.

1.  Search for and then start the **Manage BitLocker** app.

2.  Choose **Turn on BitLocker**, and then follow the instructions to encrypt each of your drives.

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, see the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
