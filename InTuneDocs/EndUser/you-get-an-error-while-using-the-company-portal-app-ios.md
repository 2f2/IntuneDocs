# You get an error while using the Company Portal app

If you get an error while you’re using the Company Portal app on your iOS device, you can send information about the error to help your IT admin troubleshoot the problem. You can send error information in different ways:

-   By tapping **Report** on error alert messages.

-   By tapping **Send Diagnostic Report** on the **About** screen of the Company Portal app

-   By shaking your device while you’re in the Company Portal app, and then tapping **Email** when the diagnostics alert appears. If the alert doesn’t appear when you shake the device, open **Settings** &gt; **Company Portal**, and make sure that the **Shake Gesture** option is on.
