# Reset your device from the Company Portal website

If your device gets lost or stolen, you might want to reset it to its factory default settings to prevent unauthorized access to your data. You can reset your device remotely by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com). The Company Portal website is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled in Intune and to do most of the same tasks that you can do when using your Company Portal app.

If you reset your device, it will no longer be listed in the Company Portal, and the device will be reset to its factory default settings. 

To reset your device:

1.  Open the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and tap the device whose name you want to change.

2.  Tap **Reset**.

Your device has now been reset.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
