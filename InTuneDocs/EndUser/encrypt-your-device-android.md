# Encrypt your device

If your company or organization requires you to encrypt your Android device before you can access company files, email, or data, follow these steps below to encrypt your device. You might be asked to set a PIN or password before encrypting if your IT administrator requires one.

If you ever unenroll your phone, it will remain encrypted. 

1.  Ensure that a screen lock PIN or password has been set for your device. 

2.  In **Settings**, click **Security** &gt; **Encrypt Phone**.
    (On some phones, youâ€™ll need to click **Storage** &gt; **Storage encryption** or **Storage** &gt; **Lock screen and security** &gt; **Other security settings** to find the "Encrypt" option).

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions. During encryption, your device might restart several times.

### What to do if you have issues
**Issue**: You have have already encrypted your device, and you see one of the following:
	-  The encryption button is disabled.
	-  You see a message saying that you still need to encrypt.
	-  You get errors when trying to use the Company Portal app.
