# Encrypt your device

If your company or organization requires you to encrypt your Android device before you can access company files, email, or data, follow these steps to encrypt your device:

1.  Ensure that your device is connected to the charger.

2.  Tap **Search**. In the Search box, type **company portal**.

3.  Ensure that a screen lock PIN or password has been set for your device.

4.  In Settings, click **Security** &gt; **Encrypt Phone**.
    (On some phones, youâ€™ll need to click **Storage** &gt; **Storage encryption**).

5.  Follow the on-screen instructions. During encryption, your device might restart several times.

6.  Ensure that your device is enrolled with Microsoft Intune by following the instructions in [Enroll your device in Microsoft Intune](enroll-your-device-in-Intune-android.md).
