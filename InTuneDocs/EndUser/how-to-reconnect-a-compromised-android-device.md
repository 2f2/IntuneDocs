# How to reconnect a compromised Android device
Your IT admin detected that you are using a rooted device. "Rooted" means that the device has been changed to enable access to the operating system, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources.

Contact your IT administrator to help you reconnect your device. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
