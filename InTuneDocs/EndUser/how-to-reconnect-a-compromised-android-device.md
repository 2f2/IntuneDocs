# How to reconnect a compromised Android device
Your IT admin detected that you are using a rooted device. "Rooted" means that the device has been changed to enable access to the operating system, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources.

Need help? Contact your IT administrator (check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) for contact information), or write the [Microsoft Android team](mailto:wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com).
