# Check compliance on your Android device

If your device hasn't checked in with Intune in a while, you might not be able to access your company or school resources. To regain access, try the following:

1. Open the Android Company Portal app on your device.

2. Tap **Check Compliance**.

If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, ask your IT administrator to reset it for you. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
