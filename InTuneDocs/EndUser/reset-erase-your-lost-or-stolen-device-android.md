# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen Android device

If a phone that has been enrolled in Intune is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory default settings by using the Company Portal app from a different device or by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).

To learn about what happens if you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-android.md).

2.  Tap **My Devices** and select the name of the lost of stolen  device.

3.  Click **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.
