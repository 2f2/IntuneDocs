# Remove your device from the Company Portal

If you decide you no longer want your device to be managed by your company or organization, you can remove it from the Company Portal by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com). The Company Portal website is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled into management with your IT department. If you remove your device, it will no longer be listed in the Company Portal, and you might also lose access to company or school data, apps, and email.

To remove your device:

1.  Open the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and tap the name of the device you want to remove.

2.  Tap **Remove**.
