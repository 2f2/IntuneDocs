# Device doesn't have BitLocker enabled

Your organization requires that you enable BitLocker, which is software that encrypts your drive and helps to protect your data. For instructions on how to enable BitLocker on Windows 10 devices, see [How to turn on BitLocker on Windows 10 devices](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-BitLocker-34294d3d). For other devices, contact your IT administrator for help. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
