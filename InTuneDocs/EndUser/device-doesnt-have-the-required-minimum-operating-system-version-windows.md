# Device doesn't have the required minimum operating system version

Your Windows device doesnâ€™t meet the minimum operating system version that your IT department requires. Before you update your mobile device, check the current operating system version by choosing **Settings** &gt; **about**. Then, to update your device, choose **Settings** &gt; **phone update** &gt; **check for updates**.

Before you update your computer, search for **operating system** and follow the prompts to identify your current operating system version. To update computers that have operating systems earlier than Windows 10, search for **Windows updates**.

To check the version for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, select the Windows logo key + R, type **winver** in the dialog box, and select Enter.

- For Windows 10, ignore the version number and look at the OS build number (example: OS Build 10586.29). The "10" in 10586.29 stands for Windows 10.
- For Windows 8.1, look at the version number. It will show 6.3.*xxxx* instead of 8.1.
