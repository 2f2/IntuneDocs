# Enroll your Windows Phone 8 device in Intune

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your devices to get access to company email, files, and other resources. Enrolling your devices enables your organization to keep corporate data secure. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md) and [What your IT administrator can and can't see on your device](what-can-your-it-administrator-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md).


To enroll your Windows Phone 8 device:

1.  On the device, tap  **Settings** &gt; **company apps**.

2.  Tap **add account**, and then sign in using your work account.

3.  After the account is successfully added, you should be prompted to install the company app or Hub. Make sure the relevant box is checked and then tap **done**.

The Company Portal will appear in your app list after it is installed.
