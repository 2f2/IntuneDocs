# Enroll your Windows RT device in Intune

These instructions are for a Windows RT device that is earlier than 8.1. If you have a Windows RT 8.1 device, follow the steps in [Enroll your Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1 device in Intune](enroll-your-w81-or-rt81-windows.md).

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your devices to get access to company email, files, and other resources. Enrolling your devices enables your organization to keep corporate data secure. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md) and [What your IT administrator can and can't see on your device](what-can-your-it-administrator-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md).


To enroll your Windows RT device:

1.  Tap **Start**, and then type **System Configuration**.

2.  Tap the dialog box to open the **Company Apps**. You may be asked to accept your companyâ€™s Terms and Conditions.

3.  Sign in using your credentials.

We also recommend that you install the Company Portal app, which lets you easily identify and get the company apps that are relevant to you and your role. Depending on how your company  configured Intune, the Company Portal app may have been installed as part of your enrollment process. To check if you have the app, look for **Company Portal** in your apps list. If you don't see the Company Portal in your list of apps, follow these steps to install it.

1.  Tap **Start** &gt; **Store**.

2.  Tap **Search** and type **company portal**.

3.  In the list of results, tap **Company Portal**.

4.  Tap **Company Portal** &gt; **Install**.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
