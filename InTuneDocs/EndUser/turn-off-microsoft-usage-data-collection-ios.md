# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about our products and services. We do this to improve the reliability and performance of our products, including the Company Portal app. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your IT admin does not have control over the collection of this data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

If you wish to turn off the collection of usage data on your iOS device, open **Settings**, tap **Company Portal**, and then turn off **Usage Data**.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
