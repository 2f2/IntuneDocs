# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

In order to improve its products and services, Microsoft automatically collects anonymous data about the reliability and performance of the Company Portal app and how it is used.

To turn off the collection of usage data on your iOS device, go to **Settings**, tap **Company Portal**, and then turn off the **Usage Data** setting.

IT administrators have no control over the collection of the data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
