# Send diagnostic data logs to your IT administrator using a USB cable

If you want to send data logs to your IT administrator to get some help with an issue, you can send the logs by using a computer and a USB cable instead of sending the logs from your mobile device. Here's how:

1.  On the error screen, tap **Send Info**. When you see a message asking which method you want to use to send the logs, choose the option that will save the files to your device.

2.  Before you start, make sure that you have your IT administrator's email address, which is typically listed on your [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) or in your Company Portal app.

2.  Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to a computer.

3.  On the computer, look for a directory that has the name of your phone. In that directory, find &lt;Android Device&gt;\Phone\Android\data\com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal\files\.

4.  Attach all of the files to an email and send them to your IT admin.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
