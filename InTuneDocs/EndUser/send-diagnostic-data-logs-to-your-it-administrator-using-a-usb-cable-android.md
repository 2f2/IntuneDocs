# Send diagnostic data logs to your IT admin using a USB cable

If you want to send data logs to your IT admin, you can send the logs by using a computer and a USB cable instead of sending the logs from your mobile device.

 Before you start, make sure that you have your IT admin's email address, which is typically listed on your [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) or in your Company Portal app.

1.  On the error screen, tap **Send Info**. When you see a message asking which method you want to use to send the logs, choose the option that will save the files to your device.

2.  Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to a computer.

3.  On the computer, look for a directory that has the name of your device. In that directory, find &lt;Android Device&gt;\Phone\Android\data\com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal\files\.

4.  Attach the files to an email and send them to your IT admin.

Still need help? Contact your IT admin. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
