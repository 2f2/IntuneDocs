# Send diagnostic data logs to your IT administrator using a USB cable

If you're using a computer rather than a mobile device, and you want to send data logs from your mobile device to have your IT admin figure out and fix your issue, use these steps:

1.  Before you start, make sure that you have your IT admin's email address. It is typically listed on your Company Portal website or in your Company Portal app.

2.  Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to a computer.

3.  On the computer, look for a directory that has the name of your phone. In that directory, find &lt;Android Device&gt;\Phone\Android\data\com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal\files\.

4.  Attach all of the files to an email and send them to your IT admin.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
