# How to reconnect a compromised iOS device
Your IT admin detected that you are using a "jailbroken" device. "Jailbroken" means that software restrictions, imposed by iOS, have been removed. The removal of these restrictions can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. 

When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources, and you must contact your IT administrator for help. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
