If your app installation is taking too long, you can try syncing your device manually, which might help to speed up the installation. Use the instructions that match the type of device you have:

* [Windows 10 Mobile](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt427782.aspx#BKMK_win10mobile_sync)
* [Windows 10 Desktop](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt427782.aspx#BKMK_win10pc_sync)
* [Windows Phone 8.1](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt427782.aspx#BKMK_winphone81_sync)
