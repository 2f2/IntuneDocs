# Sync your device manually by using the Company Portal website

If your app installation or some other task is taking too long, you can try syncing your device manually. Syncing manually might help to speed up the installation or task.

The sync feature works only for the following versions. Use the instructions that match the device you're using.

* [Windows 10 Mobile](sync-your-device-manually-windows.md#windows-10-mobile)
* [Windows 10 desktop](sync-your-device-manually-windows.md#windows-10-desktop)
* [Windows Phone 8.1](sync-your-device-manually-windows.md#windows-phone-8-1)
* [iOS](sync-your-device-manually-ios.md)
