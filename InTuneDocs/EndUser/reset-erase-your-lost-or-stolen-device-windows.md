# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device

If your enrolled Windows device is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory defaults. These steps explain how to reset your device by using the Company Portal app. You can also [reset your device from the Company Portal website](reset-your-device-cpwebsite.md).


> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factory defaults removes both your personal and work information from it. For more about what happens when you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-windows.md).

1.  In your browser, open your Company Portal, and sign in to your work account.

2.  Under **My Devices**, select the lost or stolen device.

3.  Tap **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, contact IT to reset it for you. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
