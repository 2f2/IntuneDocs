# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device

If a device that has been enrolled in Intune is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory default settings by using the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).


> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factory defaults removes both your personal and work information from it. For more about what happens when you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-windows.md)


1.  In your browser, open your [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com), and sign in to your work account.

2.  Under **My Devices**, select the lost or stolen device.

3.  Tap the **Reset** icon, and then tap **reset**.

If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, contact IT to reset it for you. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
