# What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your Windows 10 device in Intune?

When you install the Company Portal app and then use the app to enroll your Windows 10 Enterprise  or Professional device in Intune, you can then use the Company Portal app to:

-   Access the company’s network, and your email and work files

-   Get company apps from the Company Portal

-   Automatically configure your company email account

-   Reset your phone to factory settings if it is lost or stolen

For the steps to enroll, see [Enroll your Windows 10 Mobile or Windows 10 desktop device in Intune](enroll-your-w10-phone-or-w10-pc-windows.md). To learn about what your IT admin can see on your device, see [What can my IT admin see when I enroll my device in Intune?](what-can-your-it-administrator-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md).

When you add a computer:

-   Software will be installed on your computer to enable your IT administrator to manage the computer, and enable you to get to company resources like apps and support information. Your IT administrator may automatically update this software.

-   Intune Endpoint Protection may be installed on your computer. This is software that checks for viruses and malware.

-   Your IT administrator can take an inventory of all of the software installed on the computer, including software you have personally installed.

-   You may be required to accept terms and conditions.

-   Your IT administrator can collect or delete data from your computer’s hard drive. Your IT administrator could also delete the entire hard drive.

-   Your IT administrator can install apps and updates on your computer.

-   Your IT administrator may enforce policies on the computer. For example, you might be required to set a password or PIN on the computer, which may lock you out of the computer, or delete all data from your computer’s hard drive, if there are too many incorrect password attempts.

If you have questions, contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
