# About the Company Portal

## What is the Company Portal and what can you do with it?
The Microsoft Intune Company Portal gives you access to your company's or school's data and apps. You can get the Company Portal two different ways:

- By installing the Company Portal app on your device. You typically get the Company Portal app by going to your device's app store, but your IT administrator can also install the Company Portal app for you by using different methods.
- By going to the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) that your IT administrator has set up. 

There are a few minor differences between the Company Portal app and the Company Portal website, but you can do most of the same tasks on one that you can do on the other. Some examples are:

- Enroll your devices
- See the status of your devices
- Download apps that your company or school makes available to you
- Rename your device
- Reset your PIN or password
- Contact your IT department for help

To see what you can do using the Company Portal website versus using the Company Portal app on your device, choose one of the following links:

- [Windows](using-your-windows-device-with-intune.md)
- [Company Portal website](using-the-intune-company-portal-website.md)

## What happens when I add a computer or device to the Company Portal?
When you add a computer or device to the Company Portal, some software may be installed or an app may be downloaded (depending on the device).  You are also giving your IT administrator permission to manage your device to help protect the company information on the device.

To learn about what your IT administrator can and can't see on your device, use the link that matches the type of device you're using:

## Can I remove a computer or device from the Company Portal?
Yes, you can either remove or reset a computer or device from the Company Portal. There is a difference between **remove** and **reset**:

When you *remove* a computer or device, you are unenrolling your device from Intune. Once you unenroll, you won’t be able to access the Company Portal from that device anymore, and some company data may be removed from your device. To see how to remove your device from the Company Portal, choose one of the following links:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
- [Android](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md)
- [iOS and Mac OS X](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-ios.md)
- [Windows](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-windows.md)

When you *reset* a computer or device, the Company Portal tries to reset your computer or device back the manufacturer’s default settings. Resetting your device removes all company and personal data from the device! If you have lost your device, you can also reset it remotely from the Company Portal website.

To see how to reset your device, choose one of the following links:

- [iOS and Mac OS X](reset-erase-your-lost-or-stolen-device-ios.md)
- [Windows](reset-erase-your-lost-or-stolen-device-windows.md)
- [Reset your device from the Company Portal website](reset-your-device-cpwebsite.md)

## I do not see all of my devices in the Company Portal
In order to see a device, it must be added to the Company Portal. Browse to the Company Portal as directed by your administrator and follow the steps for your device. You also won’t see devices that are owned and managed by your company.
