## What is the Company Portal
The Company Portal is your company’s interface that lets you manage your work computers and devices, or manage your personal computers or devices that you choose to use at work.  The Company Portal can be a website that you go to, or can be an app that you install to your device.

## What can I do with the Company Portal
Once you add your computer or device to the Company Portal, you can browse for company apps to install, manage other devices that you have added, and find contact information for your IT administrator.

## What happens when I add a computer or device to the Company Portal
When you add a computer or device to the Company Portal, some software may be installed or an app may be downloaded (depending on the device).  You are also giving your IT administrator permission to manage your device to help protect the company information on the device.  

## What kind of computers or devices can I add to the Company Portal

-   Windows 10 Mobile

-   Windows 10 Desktop

-   Windows Phone 8.1

-   Windows 8.1

-   Windows RT devices

-   Windows Phone 8

-   iPhones, iPads, and Mac OS X

-   Android devices

## Company Portal app not supported
This version of the Company Portal can no longer be used. Install the **Company Portal** app from the Windows Store to continue.

## Can I remove a computer or device from the Company Portal
Yes, you can either remove or reset a computer or device from the Company Portal.  There is a difference between **remove** and **reset**:

-   When you remove a computer or device, you won’t be able to access the Company Portal from that device anymore, and some company data may be removed from your device.

-   When you reset a computer or device, the Company Portal attempts to reset your computer or device back the manufacturer’s default settings.  This may result in all data, both company data and personal data, being removed.

## I do not see all of my devices in the Company Portal
In order to see a device, it must be added to the Company Portal. Browse to the Company Portal as directed by your administrator and follow the steps for your device. You also won’t see devices that are owned and managed by your company.

## I need to install a new version of the Company Portal
If your version of the Company Portal is no longer supported, or there is a newer version of the Company Portal available, use the following procedures to update your device.

### To update your Windows device

1.  Navigate to the Windows Store and search for **company portal**.

2.  Follow the installation directions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are unable to access the Windows Store, contact your administrator.

### To update your iOS device

The Apple AppStore will alert you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. Follow the directions in the alert to update your device.

## I receive an error that my computer is already enrolled
This means that your computer is already added to the Company Portal, but is not linked to your user account yet. Follow this procedure to link your computer to your user account and complete the process.

### To link your computer

1.  On the computer that you wish to link to your account, click **Start** then click **Microsoft Intune Center**.

2.  Open the Company Portal.

3.  Follow the prompts to link the computer to your user account.
