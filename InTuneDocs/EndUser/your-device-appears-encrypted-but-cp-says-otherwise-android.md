# Your Android device seems to be encrypted, but Company Portal says otherwise

When you encrypt a device, you are encoding the information on it using a secret key that is known only to you and thus, prevent unauthorized people from accessing it. As a step towards making sure your information is secured, your organization is requiring you to encrypt your Android device before you can access company files, email, or data.

Some Android devices on version 7.0+ encrypt data in ways that is inconsistent with certain Android platform standards. These devices may seem to be encrypted out of the box, but Intune recognizes the methods used as putting the device's information at risk from malicious users who have physical access to the device.

> [!Note]
> Microsoft works with any listed manufacturers to try and resolve these issues, and will update this list accordingly. 

## An incomplete list of devices

If you have one of the following devices, you will experience this issue.

- [Huawei Honor 8](http://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/mobile-phones/honor8_en-sup.htm)
- [Huawei P9](http://consumer.huawei.com/mobile-phones/p9/index.html)

## Solutions

If your device offers you the option to downgrade to Android 6.0+, then do so. There is a risk of data loss if you should try to downgrade your device. Otherwise, we recommend that you contact your IT admin to resolve this issue. You can get contact information for your IT admin at the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) for contact information.
