# Enroll your Mac OS X device in Intune

Enrolling your Mac OS X device in Intune enables you to access the companyâ€™s network, your work email and work files, and lets you get company apps. For more about what happens when you enroll your device, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).

If you're trying to enroll an iOS device, see [Enroll your iOS device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).


To enroll your Mac OS X device:

1.  Using a Safari browser, open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com), and tap the notification bar.

2.  Tap **This device is either not enrolled or the Company Portal can't identify it**.
