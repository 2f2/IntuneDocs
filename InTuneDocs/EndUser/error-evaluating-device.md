# Error evaluating device
Your device was found to be noncompliant with one or more of your companyâ€™s policies, but we can't display the error right now, because the system had a problem while trying to evaluate your device.  

To solve this problem, wait a few minutes, and then tap **Check Compliance**. If the problem persists, contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
