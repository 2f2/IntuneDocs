# Device doesn't comply with the maximum operating system version

Your IT administrator has set a maximum version of the operating system that you are allowed to have on your  Windows device, but your device doesn't comply with that setting. To find out what the maximum allowed operating system is for your device, you need to contact your IT administrator. If you can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
