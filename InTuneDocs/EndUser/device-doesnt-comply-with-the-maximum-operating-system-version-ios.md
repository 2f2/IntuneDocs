# Device doesn't comply with the maximum operating system version

Your iOS device does not comply with your IT admin's policy for the maximum version of the operating system. Contact your IT admin for help. If you can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
