# Enroll your iOS device in telecom expense management

Your organization may be using telecom expense management software to ensure that their data and voice plans are being used within acceptable limits. Once you have completed enrolling your device, you will then be prompted to specify whether the device you've enrolled is a corporate or personal device.

Select the appropriate option, and you will receive a notification to install the [__Datalert__](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/datalert/id771029268?mt=8) app from the App Store. The Datalert app is how your organization can measure data usage. You will need to provide information such as your phone number and verify using a code. Once you've enrolled, you will begin to see your data usage in the Datalert app.
