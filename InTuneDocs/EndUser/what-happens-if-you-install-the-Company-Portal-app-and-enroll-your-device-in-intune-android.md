# What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your Android device in Intune?

When you install the Company Portal app and enroll your Android device in Intune, you can use the Company Portal app to:

-   Access the company’s network, and your email and work files

-   Get company apps from the Company Portal

-   Automatically configure your company email account

-   Reset your phone to factory settings if it is lost or stolen

When you enroll your Android device, you are giving your IT administrator permission to access the device. They can do things like:

-   Reset your device back to manufacturer’s defaults. This is helpful if the device is lost or stolen.

-   Remove all company related data. Your personal data and settings aren’t removed.

-   Force you to have a password or PIN on the device, which may lock you out of the device, or reset your device back to manufacturer’s default settings, which may include the deletion of data, if there are too many incorrect password attempts.

-   Require you to accept terms and conditions.

-   Enable or disable the camera on your device.

-   Force all the data, including corporate and personal data, on the device to be encrypted. This helps protect the data if the device is lost or stolen.

-   After your device is added to the Company Portal, approximately every 8 hours it will:

    -   Download any policy or app updates that your IT administrator has made available.

    -   Send any hardware inventory updates (these updates do not contain personal information).

    -   Send any company app inventory updates (these updates do not contain personal information).

Need help? Contact your IT administrator (check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) for contact information), or write the Microsoft Android team at wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com.
