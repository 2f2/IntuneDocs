# Install and sign in to the Intune Company Portal app

The Company Portal is an app that you install on your iOS device to give you access to your company or school apps, email, and network.  Before you can get access, you must install the Company Portal app, and then  use the app to enroll your device in Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).

1.  Open the **App Store** and search for **intune**.

2.  Download the **Microsoft Intune Company Portal** app.

3.  Open the Company Portal app, enter your work or school email and password, and then tap **Sign in**.

    If you are signing into the Company Portal app for the first time, and your company or school is using Intune, you will be prompted to enroll your device in Intune. To enroll, follow the steps in [Enroll your iOS device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md) or [Enroll your Mac OS X device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-intune-mac-os-x.md).

If you need help and can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
