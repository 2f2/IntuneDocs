# Your Android device isn't able to be encrypted

When you encrypt a device, you are wrapping the information on it in a layer of protective code that prevents unauthorized people from accessing it. As a step towards making sure your information is secured, your organization is requiring you to encrypt your Android device before you can access company files, email, or data.

Some Android devices use versions of encryption that is incompatible with Intune. These devices may seem to be encrypted out of the box, but Intune recognizes the methods used as putting the device's information at risk.

## An incomplete list of devices
