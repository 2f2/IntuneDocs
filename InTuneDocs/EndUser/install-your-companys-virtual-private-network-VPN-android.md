# Install your company's Virtual Private Network (VPN)

If your IT administrator has configured a VPN application to enable you to  connect to your company's resources, you'll see a notification on your Android device indicating that you need to install a VPN app. Follow these steps to install the VPN app:

1.  Pull down the notification drawer, and tap **Tap to install this required app**.

2.  In the **Play Store**, click **INSTALL** and follow the prompts to install the app.

3.  Tap **Install corporate VPN profile** and follow the prompts to accept and activate the app.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
