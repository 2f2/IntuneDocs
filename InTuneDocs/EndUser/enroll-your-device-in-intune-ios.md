# Enroll your iOS device in Intune

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your iOS device to get access to company email, files, and other resources. Enrolling your devices allows your IT department to manage those work or school resources and keep them secure, while giving you the freedom to use your preferred device to get your work done. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).

If you're trying to enroll a Mac OS X device, see [Enroll your Mac OS X device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-intune-mac-os-x.md).

If you need help and can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).


**To enroll your iOS device:**

1.  Follow the steps in [Install and sign in to the Intune Company Portal app](install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios.md).

2. On the **Company Access Setup** page, tap **Begin**.
