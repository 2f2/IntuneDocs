# What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?

When you use the Company Portal to reset your iPhone or iPad, some apps and settings on your device may be deleted, including some of your personal data. What happens on each device depends on how you are using the device, as described in the following lists.

**Your IT admin manages your mobile device**

-   Your device won’t appear in the Company Portal anymore.

-   Your device is set back to the manufacturer’s factory default settings, and your personal data, apps and settings will be removed.

**Your device can access company email only**

-   Your device won’t appear in the Company Portal anymore.

-   Your company email account will be deleted and unsaved email will be deleted.
