# Your computer is already enrolled

If you receive an error that my computer is already enrolled, it means that your computer has already been added to the Company Portal, but is not linked to your user account yet. Follow this procedure to link your computer to your user account and complete the process.

To link your computer:

1.  On the computer that you wish to link to your account, click **Start** then click **Microsoft Intune Center**.

2.  Open the Company Portal.

3.  Follow the prompts to link the computer to your user account.

If you need help and can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
