# You are asked to turn on Scan device for security threats

 If you see the message, â€œScan device for security threats," you need to go to **Settings** > **Google** > **Security**, and turn on **Scan device for security threats**.

Your IT administrator requires this setting to be turned on to protect the corporate data on your Android device. If **Scan device for security threats** is turned off, your device is less safe because it is not being checked for security threats.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
