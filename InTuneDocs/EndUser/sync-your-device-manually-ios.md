# Sync your device manually

If your app installation is taking too long, use the following instructions to manually sync your iOS device, which might help to speed up the installation. The Sync feature applies only to iOS, not to Mac OS X.

1. Open the iOS Company Portal app.

2. In the **My Devices** section, tap on the device that you are currently using. This is the left-most device tile that shows the check mark.

3.  Tap the **Sync** button shown at the bottom right of the screen.

A spinning circle appears on the screen until the sync is finished.

If you need help and can't find your IT administrator's contact information, see if it's listed on the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
