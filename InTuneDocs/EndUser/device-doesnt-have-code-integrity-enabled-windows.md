# Device doesn't have Code Integrity enabled

Your organization requires that you enable Windows Code Integrity, which is a feature that checks drivers and system files on your device to make sure they are safe. 

To enable Windows Code Integrity, enable the Secure Boot feature. The Code Integrity feature will then be turned on automatically. 

Enabling Secure Boot is an advanced task. If you are using a mobile device, contact your IT administrator for help. 

If you are using a PC, you can contact your IT administrator, or see the section “To re-enable Secure Boot” on the [Disabling Secure Boot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn898540(v=vs.85).aspx) page to try enabling Secure Boot yourself.
