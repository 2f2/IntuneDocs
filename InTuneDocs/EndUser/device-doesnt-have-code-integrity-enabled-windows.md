# You need to enable Code Integrity

Keeping your organizational information requires different types of security to prevent different types of problems. One way they want to maintain that security is to use Windows Code Integrity, which makes sure that deep-level programs (drivers) and system files haven't been modified.

Code Integrity is automatically turned on when your system actively uses Secure Boot.

> [!Tip]
> Enabling Secure Boot is an advanced task. If you are using a Windows mobile device, contact your IT administrator for help. If you a desktop device, you can contact your IT administrator.

<!--Or, see the section “To re-enable Secure Boot” on the [Disabling Secure Boot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn898540(v=vs.85).aspx) page to try enabling Secure Boot yourself.-->
