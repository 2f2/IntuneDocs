# Remotely lock a device from the Company Portal website

If your device has been lost or stolen, you can lock the device by using the Remote Lock option on the Company Portal website. Remote Lock works for the following types of devices:

Platform  |Support details  
---------|---------
Android | Supported       
iOS | Supported
Windows 10 Mobile | Supported only if the phone has a passcode set     
Windows 10 Desktop | Not supported  
Windows Phone 8.1 | Supported only if the phone has a passcode set
Windows Phone 8.0 | Not supported
PC (Windows 8.0 and earlier) | Not supported       
PC (Windows 8.1) | Not supported

**To use Remote Lock to lock your device**:

1 On the Company Portal website, tap the name of the device you want to lock.

2 Tap **Remote Lock**.

Once you tap **Remote Lock**, a “Remote lock pending” status appears.  When Remote Lock succeeds, the status changes to “Remote lock successful.”

The status displays in three places:

* The notifications area of the website. 
* The Details page for the device.
* The tile that shows the device name on the My Devices section of the page.

If you see a “Remote Lock failed” notification, wait a few minutes, and then try again to lock your device. Once you tap to retry, the status changes back to “Remote lock pending.” If a retry doesn’t work, contact your IT administrator for help. If you find your device and want to unlock it after using Remote Lock, just enter your passcode.
