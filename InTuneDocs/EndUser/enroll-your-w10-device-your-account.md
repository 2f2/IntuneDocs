If you followed the previous steps, but still can't access your work or school email address, files, or other data, try the instructions in [Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see Your account](troubleshoot-your-windows-10-device-windows.md#troubleshooting-steps-to-follow-if-you-see-your-account).

We also recommend that you install the Company Portal app, which lets you easily identify and get the company apps that are relevant to you and your role. Depending on how your company configured Intune, the Company Portal app may have been installed as part of your enrollment process.

To verify whether you have the app, look for **Company Portal** in your apps list. If you don't see the Company Portal in your list of apps, follow these steps to install it.

1.  Tap **Start** &gt; **Store**.

2.  Tap **Search**, and then type **company portal**.

3.  In the list of results, tap **Company Portal** &gt; **Install**.

4.  Tap  either **Install** or **Free**. The option that is shown depends on how your company configured the app.
