# What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?

When you use the Company Portal to reset your Android device, all apps, settings and personal data on your device will be deleted, setting your device back to its factory default settings.

If you have a Samsung Knox device, you can bo a "selective wipe" by choosing the **device remove** option from the Company Portal. Selective wipe removes only the following:

- Business apps that your IT administrator makes available to you
- Email, VPN, and WiFi
- Ability of your IT administrator to enforce certain settings

If you have questions, contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
