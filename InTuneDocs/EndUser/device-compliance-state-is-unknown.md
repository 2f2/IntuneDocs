# Device compliance state is unknown

If you see the message "Compliance state is unknown" on your device, it means that Intune is trying to check that your device complies with corporate policies. While this check is being done, you may be prevented from accessing company resources like email. Wait a few minutes for the compliance check to finish, and then try accessing corporate resources again.

If you still can't access company resources, contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
