# Your device does not meet the minimum security patch

If you see the message, â€œMinimum Android security patch level is not configured," you need to install at least the minimum security patch, or a later one. Your IT administrator requires this installation to protect the corporate data on your Android device.

The location of the current security patch level can be different, depending on which type of Android device you have. You'll need to figure out if you have a Samsung Knox device, or some other type of Android device. To determine if you have a Samsung Knox device, go to **Settings** > **About phone**. If you don't see the word "Knox" listed there, you don't have a Samsung Knox device.

**To determine the latest software version on your device:**

- Non-Samsung Knox devices: Try going to **Settings** > **About** > **Software information** > **More**, and then look under **Android security patch level**. The menu names and locations may differ slightly for different Android devices.

- Samsung Knox devices: Go to **Settings** > **About phone** > **Security software version**.

**To install the required security patch:**

- Non-Samsung Knox devices: Go to **Settings** > **About** > **Software updates**.

- Samsung Knox devices: Go to **Settings** > **System updates** > **Check for new system update**.
