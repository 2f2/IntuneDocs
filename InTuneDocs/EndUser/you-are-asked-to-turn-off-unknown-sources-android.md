# You are asked to turn off Unknown sources

If you see the message, “Installation from Unknown sources must be disabled,” you need to go to **Settings** > **Security** (on some devices, this may be **Lock screen and security** instead), and turn off **Unknown sources**.

Your IT administrator requires this setting to be turned off to protect the corporate data on your Android device. When **Unknown sources** is turned on, it allows you to install apps from unknown sources, which could be a security risk.

Once you turn off **Unknown sources**, it may take a few minutes before you can continue to use your Android device to access company or school data.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
