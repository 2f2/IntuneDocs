# Send enrollment errors to your IT administrator

If you get an error while trying to enroll your Android device in Intune, you can try enrolling again by tapping **Retry**, or send the error information to your IT admin in an email by tapping **Send info**. 

An email, addressed to your IT administrator, is automatically created and contains the logs that your IT admin needs to help troubleshoot your device.

There are different ways you can send your device's data logs to your IT administrator to get help with errors:

[Use a USB cable to send logs](send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-a-usb-cable-android.md)</br>
[Use email to send logs](send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-email-android.md)
