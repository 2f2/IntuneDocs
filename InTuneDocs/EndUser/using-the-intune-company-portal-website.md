# Using the Intune Company Portal website
The [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled in Intune.

You can use the Company Portal website  to:

-   [Reset your device passcode](reset-your-passcode-cpwebsite.md)

-   [Rename your device](rename-your-device-cpwebsite.md)

-   [Remove your device](remove-your-device-cpwebsite.md)

-   [Reset your device](reset-your-device-cpwebsite.md)

-   [Remotely lock a device](remote-lock-your-device-cpwebsite.md)

-	[Sync your device manually to speed up slow app installations](sync-your-device-manually-cpwebsite.md)

-   Find your IT administrator's contact information, if your IT admin configured it

-   See details about your device, including whether it is compliant with your company's or school's policies

-   Remotely manage your PC (works only for PCs)

You can do most of the same tasks on the **Company Portal website** that you can do by using the **Company Portal app** that you install on your device. To find out more about the Company Portal app, enrolling a device in Intune, and more, tap the link for the type of device you have:

- [Using your Android device with Intune](using-your-android-device-with-intune.md)
- [Using your iOS or Mac OS X device with Intune](using-your-ios-or-mac-os-x-device-with-intune.md)
- [Using your Android device with Intune](using-your-windows-device-with-intune.md)
