# Your Android device is rooted and you can't connect

When your Android device is rooted, it means that your device has been changed to enable certain capabilities that could compromise company resources and security. When your device is rooted, you cannot access company resources and must contact your IT admin to  help you reconnect to company resources.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
